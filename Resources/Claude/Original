Let's construct a new universe called Universe X. Universe X uses normal cartesian space and time. The only thing in this universe is a quantized aether; each quanta is called an Aexel. For this problem imagine the Aexels being evenly spaced and irregular. The Aexels are very fine grained.
Each Aexel can form bidirectional bonds with its nearest neighbors. Signals can move between Aexels. It takes exactly one Tic for a signal to move from one Aexel to the next. The fastest a signal can move is one Aexel / Tic.
These signals can form repeating patterns and like Conways GoL can translate across the Aexels. These repeating patterns are called stable state loops or rather just loops. There are two classes of loops. Edisons move linearly in a straight line (assuming very fine grained Aexels) at one Aexel / Tic which we will refer to as "the speed of light" or simply 'c'. Teslons have back and forth internal motion, which means they always net translate at < c.
Teslons continually send out a type of edison in all directions that we refer to as a 'ping'. When a ping interacts with another teslon it causes that teslon to send out a different type of edison, also in all directions, called a 'pong'.
1. Imagine 2 non-translating teslons separated by a distance 'd'. What is the roundtrip time of the ping and pong back to the original teslon 't'?
2. Imagine the teslons are translating in the same direction at a speed v (v < c). The teslons are situated perpendicular to the direction of translation. Now how long does the round trip ping and pong take? Make your answer in terms of 1, the static case. Refer to this ratio as gamma.
3. Now situate the teslons parallel to the direction of translation and recalculate the time to ping pong. Again give your answers as a ratio between this and the static case (#1), but also make use of our gamma from the perpendicular case.
