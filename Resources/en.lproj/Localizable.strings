There are things we know for certain about Universe X; there are things we can speculate about and there are many things yet to be discovered.  Hopefully, over the lifetime of this app we will be able to continually increase our knowledge and understanding of this new world.
##[So what is Universe X?]##Universe X is quite different from our own.  Our universe can, at times, seem quite magical: space curves, time dilates and both are intertwined with one another; it contains dark matter and dark energy; it is expanding and expanding at an increasing rate; God plays dice with our universe.

In contrast, Universe X is quite simple; it has no magic at all.  Universe X is entirely mechanistic.  It follows a few simple rules which are easy to understand and (hopefully) easy to model.
##[The Aexel]##Universe X consists of a large number of a single entity called an 'aexel'.

These aexels have state, they can move and flow, they can form bonds with their neighbors and send signals to those neighbors through those bonds.

And perhaps most surprisingly, they can be created and and they can be destroyed.

The entire DNA of the universe is contained in each one of these aexels.
##[Space and Time]##Unlike our own universe where space and time are quite magical notions, where space can curve and time can dilate and each is intimately intertwined with one another, in Universe X, space and time are quite intuitive and boring.

Space in Universe X does not curve or expand; it is simply a three dimensional construct which houses the aexels.  Time in Universe X does not dilate; it is simply a one dimensional construct moving at a constant rate from past to present to future, mediating the progression of the state changes of the aexels as well as their motion.  In Universe X space and time are entirely separate, entirely intuitive notions.
##[The Goal]##Of course, these facts about the aexels of Universe X leave many questions unanswered.  What is the mechanism by which aexels move?  How many dimensions of state are there?  How does their creation and destruction actually work?  Ultimately, the primary focus of this app is to discover the source code for the aexel, i.e., the DNA of Universe X.

As such, let our exploration begin...

"aether_name" = "Aether";
"aether_article" = "#[Aether]#In the 19th century it was speculated that the universe was pervaded by a static rigid aether.  This aether was the medium that allowed light waves to propagate, just as air is the medium that allows sound waves to propagate.  At the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery of Special Relativity it was realized that this aether does not exist in our universe.

In Universe X, however, not only does the aether exist, fundamentally, it is the only thing that exists.  But this aether, the aether of Universe X, has very little in common with the 19th century concept of aether.

In the 19th century concept it was believed that the planets and stars moved frictionlessly through the aether and that light traversed it at a constant rate.  As a result it was thought that it should be possible to detect differences in the speed of light moving longitudinally or latitudinally across the Earth as it orbited the Sun.

In 1887, Michelson and Morley performed their famous experiment looking for this discrepancy in the speed of light; they were shocked to discover that no such discrepancy existed.

In Universe X however, the aether is not static or rigid, rather it can move and flow.

The aether is quantized.  Just as a computer monitor is divided into a 2 dimensional grid of cells called pixels, the aether of Universe X is divided into a number of small 3 dimensional cells called aexels.

Each of these aexels has state.  The pixels of a monitor each display a single color, which when combined form an image; the aexels of the aether each have state which when combined form the matter of Universe X.

This state can change over time.  The changing of state in one aexel can, after a short delay, cause the change of state in neighboring aexels.  These changing states allow matter to translate across the aexels.

The planets, the stars and ALL matter in Universe X sit atop of this aether and smoothly slide along it.

And perhaps most shockingly, under certain circumstances, new aexels can be created and existing aexels can be destroyed.

"cellular_name" = "Cellular Automata";
"cellular_article" = "#[Cellular Automata]#In the October 1970 issue of Scientific American a curious little solitaire simulation game developed by a Cambridge Math professor was presented.  The professor, John Conway explained how to 'play' it using a chess board and some counters:

**\"- Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighboring counters survives for the next generation.
- Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies (is removed) from overpopulation. Every counter with one neighbor or none dies from isolation.
- Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors--no more, no fewer--is a birth cell. A counter is placed on it at the next move.\"**

At that time it was perhaps difficult to imagine such a 'recreational mathematics' hobby project would become so influential.

A cellular automaton is a system consisting of an (often 2 dimensional) grid of cells each having some state. These cells have connections to a defined set of neighbors that they can communicate with; i.e., its neighborhood.

The system progresses using a discrete concept of time called a time step. Inherent in the system is a static set of rules that dictate how each cell's state changes based on its own state and the states of the other cells in its neighborhood.

The simple rules of Conway's Game of Life are able to exhibit an amazing amount of complexity.  Initially, when the cells of such a system are randomly populated the progression of state will be quite chaotic, but eventually repeating patterns will automatically arise.

Such cellular automata have a number of similarities to Universe X.  For example Universe X is also made up of a set of discrete cells, 3 dimensional in this case.  These cells also have state and the state changes of these cells often loop back creating stable state loops.

In Universe X these loops can persist for long periods of time, have properties of their own and interact with other such loops.  These loops are the basis of all 'matter' in Universe X.

The matter of Universe X is not fundamental.  It is not made up of point particles; it is not made up of waves; it does not displace the aether.  Matter is made up of stable state loops that exist on top of the aether.

However, there are also some differences between Universe X and most cellular automata.  Unlike the static cells of Conway's game of life, the cells of Universe X are dynamic; they can move, they can be created and they can be destroyed.  The creation and destruction of aexels creates density imbalances which are the ultimate cause of the flow of the aether.

In a cellular automaton, a computer will calculate each time step in its entirety before moving the system forward.  There is no such master computer in Universe X.  There is simply a time delay in transferring information from one aexel to its neighbors.  This delay is called a 'tic'.

Each aexel can only directly affect its neighbors and this effect takes one tic of time to occur.  Therefore the fastest a signal can move across a field of aexels is one aexel per tic.

In Universe X, one aexel per tic is referred to as 'the speed of light'.

"kinematics_name" = "Kinematics";
"kinematics_article" = "#[Kinematics]#In our universe (non quantum) motion without forces is quite straightforward; each object has a position and a velocity and that's all there is to it.  Most things in Universe X are substantially less complicated than in our universe.  In this case, Universe X is considerably more complicated.

In the Cellular Automata section, a stable state loop was described as a closed set of cells with a certain state at time t, that returns to that same state at a later time.  However, this definition is perhaps unnecessarily restrictive.

If one observes Conway's Game of Life long enough they may notice a very interesting phenomenon.  Occasionally a pattern of cells arise that while persisting, does not do so in place; it 'moves'.  The most common such stable state loop in Game of Life is called a glider, which repeats its pattern every 4 time steps while translating diagonally by one cell during those 4 time steps.

{{GameOfLife}}

The matter of Universe X is made up of analogous stable state loops; loops that can translate across the aexels while continuing their existence.  But, this translation of the stable state loop is only one of the ways it can change its position.

Since the aexels themselves can move, it is possible for a stable state loop sitting on top of those aexels to move along with them, like a leaf floating down a stream.  It may also be the case (and most likely usually is) that both types of these motions are happening simultaneously.

##[Translating Stable State Loop]##Conway's Game of Life's 'glider' is a translating stable state loop.  The matter of Universe X is made of analogous translating stable state loops.  Obviously the term 'translating stable state loop' will quickly get unwieldy, so let's simply refer to them as 'loops' or 'particles' interchangeably (in order to better interact with the physics of our universe).  Just keep in mind 'translating stable state loop' is what is meant and that the particles of Universe X are not point particles.

##[How Big are Particles?]##If the particles of Universe X are not point particles, then how big are they?  In our universe there is a notion of minimum distance called the Planck length.  In Universe X, there is absolutely a minimum distance, the distance between two bonded aexels.

Now there is a lot of fuzziness on the exact numerical value of the Planck length, but if we tentatively assume that magnitude of the Planck length (1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m) is in the ballpark of the distance between two aexels then this distance is spectacularly small compared to the radius of a proton.

Consider this, if we were to expand the Planck length to 1 nm, a similarly expanded proton placed at the center of the solar system would extend to 35% of the distance to the Earth.  Which is to say that the particles of Universe X are gargantuan compared to the aexels.

##[Edisons and Teslons]##The fastest a signal can move in Universe X is one aexel per tic, referred to as the speed of light.  Certain particles move at the speed of light, others move at less than the speed of light, but no particle can do both; this seems like a good way to classify particles.

A frisbee flies through the air at a velocity v, but the frisbee is also spinning while it flies.  As such, nearly half of the atoms of the frisbee are moving faster than v while nearly half are moving slower than v.

Any system with internal motion will need some of its components to be traveling faster than the system itself at any point in time.  Since nothing can travel faster than c, a system with internal motion will never be able to travel at c.

Perhaps this is what differentiates particles that travel at c and those that travel at less than c.  Some particles move in a straight line directly from one point to another at c; let's refer to these particles as edisons.  Other particles have internal structure and alternate their motion back and forth in some manner resulting in a net velocity of less than c; let's refer to these particles as teslons.

"gravity1_name" = "Gravity\nI";
"gravity1_article" = "#[Gravity I]#**Nearly all the mechanisms in Universe X are quite straightforward.  However, the exact mechanism underpinning gravity in Universe X isn't as immediately obvious.  At this point the tools needed to fully understand gravity in Universe X haven't been discussed yet.  A more complete description of gravity exists in the Gravity II article placed after those needed tools have been fully developed.  Additionally, a thorough description of the thinking behind gravity can be found in the 'Path of Discovery'.**
Gravity is the tendency of objects with mass to move towards one another.

Isaac Newton first described the gravity of our universe as a force that all objects exert on one another across any arbitrarily large distance, proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

But, he acknowledged some discomfort with this idea:
**\"That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.\"**
When Einstein described his theory of Relativity he shifted our understanding of gravity.  He described gravity as being a result of the warping of spacetime caused by all objects with mass.

But, even with Newton and Einstein's contributions to gravity we still really don't understand what gravity is and why it exists.  In our own universe, gravity remains a mystery.

However, in Universe X, gravity isn't quite as mysterious.  Ultimately, gravity is manifested by the flow of aexels.

In Universe X there exist many different types of loops.  There are potentially three ways these loops could interact with the aexels: they could pull on the aexels (leading to their destruction), they could push on the aexels (leading to their creation; see the Darkness article) or they could do neither (see Electromagnetism article).

The loops that pull on aexels have a coefficient which measures the magnitude of this pull.  In Universe X this pull coefficient is called 'mass'.

Gravity isn't a force on matter, but rather a force on the aexels themselves.  The acceleration that matter feels is simply the acceleration of the aexels that that matter is sitting upon.

As such, it makes no difference how much mass an object sitting on the aexels has or even if that matter is a photon; all matter experiences the same acceleration, because it is the aexels that are being pulled on, not the objects sitting upon them, which are simply coming along for the ride.

As various concentrations of matter continually tug on the aether between one another, the matter itself will continually tend to clump together.  As that clump of matter gets bigger and bigger (or perhaps more precisely, more and more dense) the velocity at which the aether is pulled towards the clump will increase.

At some point, certain clumps in Universe X get so big (dense) and the velocity of the aexels flowing towards the clump becomes so great that a signal moving at one aexel per tic ('the speed of light') will not be able to escape the clump.  In Universe X, any clump that draws aether in at the speed of light is referred to as a black hole.

"gravity2_name" = "Gravity\nII";
"gravity2_article" = "#[Gravity II]###[Special Relativity]##Standard General Relativity notation can be used to describe Special Relativity.  Consider a spaceship traveling at velocity 𝑐/2 over flat space in our universe.

There is a convention in General Relativity that relates the dilation and contraction of a particular inertial frame (called the proper frame) to an inertial frame at infinity (called the coordinate frame).

This convention calculates how time and distance in the stationary reference frame appear when measured by instruments in the moving frame. The observed time interval is multiplied by the speed of light to convert it to an equivalent distance. This time-derived distance is then subtracted from the observed spatial measurement. The resulting difference represents the fundamental quantity 'spacetime' and is denoted by ds.

For example, recall the Lorentz factor:

<<G2Eq01>>

For a spaceship traveling at 𝑐/2, γ will be approximately equal to 1.155.  Time will be slowed in the moving ship, so a second at infinity will only appear to be 0.866 seconds long.  The meter stick will be contracted on the moving space ship and so a meter stick at infinity will appear to be 1.155 meters long.

We can then calculate the 'spacetime' by taking x - 𝑐 t ≈ 1.155 - 0.866 𝑐.

Using the standard General Relativity notation this calculation can be represented as:

<<G2Eq02>>
##[General Relativity]##After many years and the help of a number of mathematicians Einstein developed his field equations:

<<G2Eq03>>

The G and T elements here represent 4 by 4 tensors, each is a function of a 4D point in spacetime, resulting in a 10 equation 10 unknown partial differential equation on a 4 dimensional manifold.  After a century, these equations have been solved for only a handful of highly simple and symmetric geometries.

One of those solutions is the Schwarzschild Metric, which describes the spacetime geometry exterior to a perfect stationary non-rotating spherical mass.  The Schwarzschild Metric is as follows:

<<G2Eq04>>

At first glance this equation looks quite complicated.  However, there are a few ways we can simplify it.  The metric uses spherical coordinates.  The last term involving the dθ and dϕ angles is exactly the same for flat spherical coordinates and as such there is no interesting physics going on there, as such that term can be ignored and the focus can be placed solely on the radial motion.

Previously, in the Four Leafs article we used classical mechanics to derive the escape velocity around a spherical mass.  The result was:  <<G2Eq05>>

At this point, looking at the Lorentz factor, the escape velocity and the Schwarzschild metric minus the angles term, an interesting substitution can be made.  If one substitutes in γ(vₑ) (and ignores the angles term), the Schwarzschild metric becomes:  <<G2Eq06>>

Suddenly, the Schwarzschild metric doesn't look too complicated and one might also note that it is precisely the same as the Special Relativity equation from above.  An obvious physical interpretation pops out.  This is just a static system with an aether flowing through it at the escape velocity and as such it behaves exactly like a translating system on flat space.

SR = GR

A much stronger version of the equivalence principle appears, that a system in free fall is precisely the same as a system in flat space.  And it doesn't appear as an axiom, but a transparently obvious consequence of the physical mechanisms in play.

Furthermore, the dr component in this equation simply represents the length contraction of meter sticks at that point (because of the flow of aether).  As such there is zero warping of the aether and there is not even any compression of the aether.  Not only is space flat in Universe X, but the aether is flat also.  'Space' isn't warping, rather meter sticks at those points are contracting making the distance from that point to the center to appear to be longer than it should be because it's being measured by shrunken meter sticks.

##[Squish]##According to the Gravity I article, gravity is not a force on other masses, but rather is a force on the aexels themselves; this creates an issue.  If the aexels are flowing in at the escape velocity then we can multiply the escape velocity by the surface area of each shell and see that the flux is not constant:

<<G2Eq07>>

This varies with r^(3/2).  There is no way the aexels can be conserved.  There is no way Gauss' law can apply.  In Universe X, aexels do not satisfy Gauss' law.  They are very fragile and when a pressure is applied to them beyond a certain threshold they get squished and disappear entirely.  This allows for the aexel density to stay largely fixed.  (For a much more thorough discussion of how this mechanism was discovered, refer to the 'Squish' article on the 'Path of Discovery'.)

##[Accelerant]##Hyle pulls on the aexels themselves inducing an acceleration:

A = GM/r².

Given our experience from Electromagnetism of how to construct a 1/r² force, it would be possible to conjecture that there is a similar mechanism at use here.  Theoretically, each bit of hyle could send out g-pings in all directions that apply some sort of acceleration to the aexels themselves.  These g-pings fall off at 1 / 4pi r², giving us our perfect 1/r² force on the aexels.

However, while that works conceptually, logistically, it's intractable.  Unlike E&M which is generally quite short range, gravity has to work across the entire Universe.  And as mentioned in the Kinematics article, E&M phenomena are huge compared to gravity.  The mechanisms in play in E&M can be much more complex, gravity needs to be simple.  And since the aexels are so small and since each needs to get hit at any distance from any bit of hyle, the amount of 'particles' that need to be tracked is just ridiculous.  But, there are actually two ways to get a 1/r² effect.  Certainly, a volley of dust sent out everywhere can achieve the effect.  But, as the InsideOut lab pointed out, for a fluid being destroyed and pulled in, the velocity of the fluid will also create a 1/r² effect.  Essentially, it's the removal of fluid that is spreading out a 1/r².

Of course this removal creates a velocity and not an acceleration.  However, this leaves an entirely tractable way of calculating the gravity throughout the entire universe at O(n).

Imagine each aexel holds a fluid called 'accelerant'.  Hyle doesn't destroy aexels, it destroys accelerant.  This accelerant then flows to replace the destroyed accelerant.  The velocity of the accelerant flowing causes an acceleration on the aexels it is flowing through.

Now the gravity problem goes from being an absurd tracking of an absurd amount of g-pings traveling throughout the entire universe, to a simple local pressure equalization problem of the accelerant.

Now, of course, this is a leap well beyond anything previous in Universe X.  And the reason for making this leap is novel, the concern for the computational strain of Universe X itself.  However, even if this is entirely false, this concept could greatly speed the modeling of gravitational phenomena.  It takes a problem naively implemented as O(n²) that is reduced to  O(n ln(n)) by using approximate methods and replaces it with a method that is O(n) and precise, not an approximation any longer.

"darkness_name" = "Darkness";
"darkness_article" = "#[Darkness]#Astronomers observing our own universe have noticed some problems with our current understanding of Physics.  There are two major issues: One, is that for unknown reasons the universe itself appears to be expanding.  The other is that the galaxies of our universe appear to have greater gravitational pull than they should based on the amount of mass that they contain.

From these observations they realized that our universe contains dark energy which causes the universe to expand and dark matter which gives the galaxies more mass than they appear to have.

The mass of dark energy and dark matter account for about 96% of the mass of the universe.  Our observable universe only accounts for 4% of what exists.  96% percent of the mass of the our own universe has never been observed.

(Technically, Dark Energy causes the *acceleration* of the expansion of the universe.  The actual current 'mainstream' view is that expansion is simply the magical natural state of the universe with no cause what-so-ever.)

Luckily, once again, Universe X isn't nearly so magical.

##[Dark Energy]##In the Gravity I article it was mentioned that there are potentially three ways that loops could interact with the aexels: they could pull on the aexels (leading to their destruction), they could push on the aexels (leading to their creation) or they could do neither.

This article concerns the loops that push on aexels or perhaps more precisely (based on the concepts of the Gravity II article) the loops that are the source of 'accelerant'.  Let's call those loops 'antimatter'.

In our universe, there is a phenomenon known as pair creation.  Of the many known particles of our own universe each has an antiparticle that is equal and opposite in every way.  If it is the case that a matter loop is an accelerant sink then perhaps it is also the case that an antimatter loop is an accelerant source.

And while the matter of Universe X clumps up into galaxies and stars and planets continually causing the flow of accelerant inward, thereby pulling in aexels themselves and consequently the matter sitting upon those aexels.

The antimatter of Universe X spreads out as a dust permeating the space between those galaxies continually creating new accelerant that causes the aexels to accelerate away from it.  And certainly there must also be an inverse of the squish mechanism that will cause an aexel to spawn once the aexel density gets too low, thereby maintaining the flat aether.

It has been observed that at times a particle and its antiparticle can be created.  Similarly, if a particle and its antiparticle meet they can each be destroyed.  As such perhaps it's the case that the total matter in Universe X is always equal to the total antimatter.

And if a matter loop removes accelerant at the same rate that an antimatter loop adds accelerant then perhaps the total amount of accelerant is constant and likely the destruction of aexels through the squish mechanism is balanced by formation of aexels via the spawn mechanism.

This net teleportation of aexels from inside of galaxies to outside of galaxies could then account for a red shift of photons traveling through the antimatter dust; making a steady state universe appear to be expanding.

##[Dark Matter]##If this explains the expansion of Universe X, what about the 'Dark Matter'?

Any flow of accelerant could either be caused by a sink pulling the accelerant inward or a source pushing the accelerant outward.  It can be difficult to tell the difference between a pull and a push.

If the galaxies of Universe X are filled with matter loops pulling from the inside, perhaps they are also surrounded by antimatter loops pushing from the outside; the same antimatter loops that are causing the aether between galaxies to expand.

As such the antimatter dust of Universe X both causing the 'expansion' of the aether between galaxies and the push on the galaxies from the outside which can be difficult to differentiate from a pull coming from the inside.

       - Dr. House**
A young lady places a playing card in the spokes of her bike using a clothes pin; her tires are wet because she just rode through a puddle.  Assuming she is always moving at a constant speed, the bike draws tire marks on the road at a constant rate while the card is clicking at a constant volume.  As such the proportion of tire marks being drawn to sound being made is constant.  If the number of bicycles doubles, both the volume of the clicking and rate of tire marks drawn each double while their proportion stays the same.

{{bicycle}}

If she rides around and around in a circle it is easier to hear the sound (because it's nearby) and more difficult to see the tire marks (because she keeps riding over the same marks).  If she rides in a straight line it is easier to see the tire marks and harder to hear the sound.

But no matter how she is riding, the bike is always drawing tire marks and always making sound and always in the same proportion.  Just because she starts riding in a straight line, sound isn't suddenly converted into tire marks and just because she starts riding in a circle, tire marks aren't suddenly converted into sound.

If one measures the sound or if one measures the tire marks, what they are really measuring is the number of bikes by observing the effects of those bikes.

In Universe X there is a conserved quantity; let's call it 'hyle' (a nod to Aristotle).  Hyle always translates at the speed of light and always pulls on aexels as it translates and always in the same proportion.  Two separate effects of a single entity; the translation effect associated with energy, the aexel pull effect associated with mass.

There are two types of particles in Universe X, teslons that have internal motion and thus always must travel at less than c (an aexel per tic) and edisons that simply move in a straight line always at exactly c.  But, the hyle in teslons and edisons is always moving (at c) and always pulling on aexels and always in the same proportions.

The motion of the hyle in the teslon is less obvious because it's mostly bouncing back and forth.  The pull of aexels in the edisons is less obvious because it's always happening in the edison's wake, never internal to itself.  But, in both cases both effects are always occurring and always in the same proportion.

Consider our own sun, which loses about 4 x 10⁹ kg of mass every second through the fusion process; radiating about 3.6 × 10²⁶ joules of photons.  Since photons are supposedly massless, this process is often described as mass being converted into energy.  But in looking at Universe X, we can see that is not what is happening.

During the process 4 hydrogen atoms are fused into a single Helium atom, but the hyle in 4 hydrogen atoms is greater than the hyle in a single helium atom, so the excess gets expelled as photons (and 2 antineutrinos).

The hyle is going from bouncing back and forth within the hydrogen atoms to translating in a straight line within the photon.  It is still translating at the speed of light; it is still pulling on aexels.  Nothing has been converted into anything else.  The only thing that has changed is the hyle has gone from bouncing around to moving in a straight line.

And while the pull of aexels isn't happening inside the photons themselves, it is happening in their wake.  The photons are still causing the mass effect.  The photons have mass.

It is not mass that prevents something from moving at the speed of light, but rather internal motion.





";

"dilation_name" = "Dilation";
"dilation_article" = "#[Dilation]#Perhaps one of the most magical aspects of our universe is the phenomenon of time dilation.

In our universe time dilation is the variation in the perceived rate of time of various frames of reference based on their relative velocity to one another as well as the relative difference in their gravitational field strength.  That the rate of time itself can vary in our universe is severely magical in and of itself.

But, perhaps the most magical aspects of time dilation arise from the fact that in our universe there are no special frames of reference.  For example, two space ships traveling parallel to one another in opposite directions near the speed of light will both note that their clocks are running at a different rate than the other ship's clocks.  But, the really weird part is that both ships will see their own clock running faster and the opposing ship's clocks moving slower.

In Universe X, however, no such time dilation occurs.  There is however an analogous phenomenon, which is perhaps better described as 'animation dilation'.

Previously, the stable state loops of Universe X have been discussed as single entities.  However, the loops themselves have properties of their own and are able to interact with other loops in order to create increasingly large and complex composite systems.

The loops of Universe X fall into one of two categories: loops that translate at the speed of light (one aexel per tic) and loops that translate at less than the speed of light.

Let's refer to those loops that translate directly in a straight line (at the speed of light) as 'edisons' and those loops that translate in some sort of alternating fashion (at less than the speed of light) as 'teslons'.

In Universe X teslons can interact with one another in order to create increasingly complex composite systems.  The interaction of these teslons will entirely be mediated by edisons.  Therefore the rate that the teslons will animate will entirely be dependent on the amount of time it takes the edisons to move back and forth between them.

For two stationary teslons separated by a fixed number of aexels the edisons will travel between them at one aexel per tic.  However, if the teslons are both translating across the aexel field, the amount of time it takes edisons to move between them will vary based on the direction of motion of the edisons relative to the translating motion of the teslons across the aexel field.

In some cases the time will be less, in others the time will be more, but in all cases the time of the roundtrip journey of an edison between the teslons will increase as the rate of translation increases.  This increased time will result in a slow down of the rate of the animation of the composite system of loops.

This dilation in Universe X is substantially different than the dilation of our universe.  For one thing, there IS a special frame of reference in Universe X.  A system will animate most quickly when it is not translating across the aexels at all, allowing the edisons to move most quickly between the teslons.

In Universe X dilation is not an observational phenomena.  It is a real physical phenomena that is entirely dependent on a system's rate of translation.  A system not translating at all will animate quickest; other systems will animate slower and slower as their rate of translation increases towards the speed of light, i.e. one aexel per tic.

In Universe X, two observers translating across the aexels in different frames will both agree on the relative animation rate of the two systems.  Both will see a fast system and a slow system and they will both agree on which is which.  There is no twin paradox in Universe X.

Let's try to calculate the animation dilation in Universe X as a function of the translational velocity of a system across an aexel field.  Two loops are arranged perpendicular to the aexel flow (north / south).  A signal traveling at c is sent out from one to the other and back.

The question is how long does this roundtrip journey take?

First, let's look at the case where v = 0, the loops are not moving at all relative to the aexel field.  In this case the total distance traveled is 2d at a speed of c and total time, t = 2d/c.

<<DilaSketch>>

In the second case, the loops are translating across the aexels at some non-zero velocity, therefore the signal must travel a greater distance along the aexel field in order to complete its journey.  The journey north takes time, tₙ.  The signal therefore travels ctₙ while the system moves vtₙ.  Using the Pythagorean theorem we then get:

<<Dilation>>

So, for a system of loops translating across an aexel field the signals traveling between loops will take longer and therefore the animation of that system will slow down entirely as a function of the rate of translation across the aexels and that slowing down will be by the (perhaps familiar) equation above.

"contraction_article" = "#[Contraction]#Length Contraction is a phenomenon that causes all things to shrink in the direction of motion or in the direction of gravity.

In our universe, length contraction, similar to time dilation, has no special frames of reference, length contraction is an observational phenomena.  Two parallel spaceships passing each other at high speed will both see meter sticks on the other ship as being smaller then their own.

In Universe X, however, length contraction is a physical phenomenon and like dilation, is entirely a function of the rate of translation of a system across an aexel field.  A system that is not translating across an aexel field will experience no length contraction at all.  However, a system that is translating across an aexel field will experience a contraction in the direction of translation (or aexel flow from the perspective of the system itself) that is entirely a function of the rate of that translation.

In our universe there is a feature of nature called Lorentz covariance which indicates that the speed of light is constant across all frames of reference.

In Universe X this concept would appear to break down quickly.  For any system that is translating across an aexel field it would seem that the speed of light parallel to the direction of the aexel flow would be different than the speed of light perpendicular to the flow.

Certainly, in Universe X, the speed of light is always one aexel per tic.  But, since aexels can flow through a static system or a translating system can move across static aexels, it would seem that it might be easy to detect variations in the distance light travels per time in various directions.

However, Lorentz covariance also holds in Universe X, just as it does in our universe.  And it does so because of length contraction.

In the Dilation article we calculated the increased amount of time needed to bounce an edison moving at the speed of light between two teslons when the edison is sent out orthogonal to the direction of translation (north / south).

For this article let's now repeat the same calculation but for an edison sent out parallel to the direction of translation (east / west).  Let's start by calculating when the velocity of translation is zero.

In this case the signal travels 2d (the distance to the target) at a velocity of 'c' (the speed of light), so total time, t is 2d/c.

<<ContraSketch>>

Now let's start translating the same system over the aexel field.  While the signal is moving to the right it is 'chasing' the target therefore the total distance it needs to cover is 'd' the distance to the target plus vtₑ, v being the velocity of translation and tₑ being the time needed to hit the target moving to the right.  Let's calculate that time, tₑ:

<<ContraEast>>

Once the signal bounces off the target back to the source, the source will be moving towards the signal so the total distance that needs to be covered is d minus vt_w, the translation velocity times the time needed to return to the source.  Let's calculate that time t_w:

<<ContraWest>>

The total time, t' is equal to the sum of tₑ and t_w.  Let's compare it to the time when the system is not translating at all.

<<Contra>>

For the orthogonal case we saw that the time increased by a factor of gamma, but in this parallel case the time is increasing by a factor of gamma squared.  Which would mean that for a translating system two edisons sent out at the same time, both bounced off equidistant teslons, one orthogonal to the direction of translation, one parallel, the two signals would return at different times.  Unless...

Length Contraction occurs and the length of things in the direction of translation are reduced by a factor of gamma.  In that case both signals would return at the exact same moment and the 'speed of light' would appear to be the same in both directions.

The amount of contraction precisely masks the change in the speed of light caused by the flow of aexels.  In Universe X, a meter stick's length itself is a function of the speed of light.  As the speed of light changes; the meter stick's length changes.

Measuring the speed of light with a meter stick is essentially a tautological exercise.  A meter stick uses the speed of light to measure the speed of light and not shockingly it always comes out to be: the speed of light.

One other important thing to note, is that this contraction only applies to the physical items in the system that is translating, not to the rest of the non-translating universe that happens to lie along the direction of translation.

If a ship is heading towards some distant star, the amount of contracted meter sticks that will fit between the ship and the star will increase as the translation speed of the ship increases.  The distance to the star itself will not contract and therefore the distance to the star will appear to increase as the ship's speed increases.

"electromagnetism_article" = "#[Electromagnetism]###[1 / r²]##Imagine a pile of N grains of salt sitting on a table.  Push a finger into the pile and swirl it around creating a ring of salt of radius r.  The amount of salt at any point of the ring is N divided by 2π r; now repeat the experiment in 3D, creating a shell of salt instead of a ring.  The amount of salt at any point on the shell will be N divided by 4π r².

In nature, any value that falls off at 1 / r² strongly hints at being underpinned by a mechanism analogous to these salt particles that are uniformly radiating outward spherically.
##[Dilation and Contraction]##The Dilation and Contraction articles showed that the dilation and contraction relativistic effects could simply be derived by noting the roundtrip time delay of light speed traveling edisons journeying between two sub light speed teslons.

This hints at electricity and magnetism being mediated by an outgoing edison (a ping) followed by a response edison (a pong) resulting in a physics that exhibits dilation, contraction and ultimately, Lorentz covariance.
##[Hyle]##The E=mc² article introduced the conserved quantity hyle and argued that hyle was contained in both teslons and photons.  It also indicated that hyle exhibits two effects: translation, associated with energy and the tugging on the aether, associated with mass.  It illustrated why these two effects are always proportional to the amount of hyle in a system and as such always proportional to one another.

Additionally, we can conjecture that not only is hyle conserved universally, but perhaps it is also conserved locally at each and every point in Universe X; it never just jumps from one spot to another without moving between each point in between.
##[The Ping]##Imagine two teslons in close proximity to one another.  Each teslon has no idea where the other teslon is or even that another teslon even exists.  In E&M therefore, the very first step must be for each teslon to send out a volley of edisons out in all directions.

{{EMImg1}}

In the Gravity I article, it was conjectured that there were three types of loops: those that pulled on the aether, those that pushed on the aether and those that did neither.  Which of these types is the ping?

Loops that pull on the aether contain hyle.  If pings contained hyle then a proton sitting in the middle of nowhere would quickly exhaust all of its internal hyle by sending it out in those pings.  But this does not happen; protons persist forever.  These omni directional pings must be hyleless and as a result do not push or pull on the aexels.

Therefore the ping is a volley of omnidirectional hyleless edisons.
##[The Pong]##A target teslon encounters a ping sent out from another teslon and now it wants to send out a response pong back to the source teslon letting it know that it received its ping.  Is this pong response akin to the ping, hyleless and omnidirectional?  Or alternatively, does it contain hyle and/or is it sent out as a single directed edison that somehow knows the exact trajectory required to reconnect with the source teslon?

One of these questions we can answer definitively.  Consider three teslons in close proximity to one another: A, B and C.  Each sends out omnidirectional pings.  If C sends out omnidirectionally pongs for both the pings received from A and B, then A would receive the pongs from C not just for itself, but also those motivated by B.  As a result the Coulomb force on A from C would be the sum of all forces C has on all nearby teslons.

This is obviously not how the Coulomb force works.  Pongs can not be sent out omnidirectionally; they must somehow be sent out in a directed fashion so that only the motivating teslon receives their response.

The answer to the question of whether the pong contains hyle or not, however, is not so clear.  Consider two teslons aligned parallel to the direction of translation, one following the other, both translating at 0.5 c.  Both send out pings.  The leading teslon's ping will arrive at the trailing teslon sooner than the trailing teslon's ping will arrive at the leading teslon.  If the pong response contains hyle then each teslon will recoil when they send that pong out.  But, this reaction will not be synchronized; the trailing teslon will react sooner than the leading teslon.

In order for the reactions to be synced, the pong must too be hyleless.  Once the hyleless pong is received by the source teslon, finally a hyled edison (a photon) will be released.  This photon release and the associated recoil will now be synchronized for both the leading and trailing teslons.

But then, what happens when that photon arrives at the target teslon and is absorbed by it?  This photon kick will once again not be synced.

Perhaps since the flow of pings and pongs is continuous these out of sync reactions are just edge effects that don't affect the dynamics.  Or perhaps there is something more sophisticated going on in this hyle exchange.
##[The Cupola]##Imagine two teslons, S(ource) and T(arget) situated perpendicular to the direction of translation traveling at 70% the speed of light.  The ping that eventually travels from S to T will have left S at an angle θ from S's translation vector.  However, the force applied to T will be straight upward, not aligned with the translation vector of the ping.  How does the T teslon know which direction to move in response to this ping?

<<EMImg2>>

All pings must be encoded with a 'cupola' vector which indicates which direction the force should be applied.  Calculating this encoded cupola vector is relatively straight forward.  It is simply the absolute translation vector of the ping of length c minus the translation vector of the source teslon of length v, its rate of translation.

This resultant cupola vector will tell the target teslon which direction the force is applied.  But, this cupola vector also has an additional usage, it can act as a return address enabling the target teslon to determine the exact trajectory needed to respond to the source teslon.

By reflecting the absolute translation vector of the ping across the cupola vector, the pong can be sent out on a trajectory that is guaranteed to intersect the source teslon *if* it continues at a constant velocity.

The below image shows each of the pings radiating from a source teslon traveling at 70% c.  The pings are rendered as little footballs whose axis is aligned with the cupola.  The white lines represent absolute vector of translation of the ping across the static aether.  One might note that while all the translation vectors point away from the location of the teslon when it released the volley (the center of the ring), the cupolas all point at the current position of the teslon.

{{EMImg3}}

And thus, in this small packet of information contained in the ping, both the direction of the force and the return to sender trajectory can be determined.

But perhaps, we haven't completely exhausted the beauty of the cupola quite yet...

"quantum_name" = "Quantum Mechanics";
"quantum_article" = "#[Quantum Mechanics]#Previously, there has not been much explicit discussion about Quantum Mechanics in the Aexels app.  I had felt that the quantized Aether and unknown hidden variables represented by the precise geometry of the aexels at any point in time was enough to explain much of the odd behavior underpinning Quantum.

But as I have waded deeper into the mechanisms of Electricity and Magnetism, it is becoming clear that there is more going on here than just a quantized Aether.  The cupola mechanism has worked shockingly well in explaining much of the E&M phenomena, but the failure to fully model hyle transfer has exposed a shortcoming in understanding the region where E&M and Quantum meet.

Certainly, the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum is anathema to the aesthetics of Universe X, but perhaps more physical interpretations are available.  Consider the standard electron in an infinite walled box problem.  The solution to the Schrödinger equation is:

<<QMEq01>>

Now imagine a disk with a mirrored wall glued to its face across its diameter with surface area A.  We place this disk in a slot where it can roll back and forth, x = 0 when it is all the way to the left and x = L when it is all the way to the right.  When the disk is at one of the barriers its mirror must be vertical.  However, it can roll a half time, a full time or any number of rotations n/2 to get back and forth between the two walls.

<<quantum_diag>>

What is the surface area of the mirror when looked at from above?  For some angle θ from vertical it will be A sin(θ).  θ is nπ times x/L.  This gives the final cross sectional area from above as:

<<QMEq02>>

This looks suspiciously familiar.

Who knows what, if anything, this means, but hopefully substantial progress will continue and, like E&M with version 4, Quantum will come more into focus with version 5.





";

"nuclear_name" = "Nuclear Forces";
"nuclear_article" = "#[Nuclear Forces]#To date there has been zero discussion of the Weak and Strong interactions in Universe X.  However, with the progress made in E&M it is perhaps time to start thinking about them; both because things are getting closer to their realm and because the relative simplicity of the E&M mechanism may indicate that these mechanism might not be insanely complicated either.

At this point both the Weak and Strong interaction are basically entirely not understood in Universe X.  But, here is some extremely early speculation.

One might note that while much progress has been made in E&M since version 3.0 of the Aexels app one aspect of E&M remains entirely unmodeled, the notion of a charge.  It is assumed that a particle with charge is an endless font of hyleless pings, but what is the exact mechanism in play here.  Perhaps the Weak interaction with its Z+, Z- and W particles will provide some insight in this regard.

The Strong interaction with its unshearable quarks seems capable of containing hyle, of bouncing it back and forth in a confined space like a massless mirrored box.  Somehow the quarks are able to pass back and forth gluons which are themselves hyleless edisons in order to maintain this structure while also confining the hyle.

All of this hints at another missing mechanism.  Any particle that has mass must have internal structure and internal motion in Universe X; hyle must be able to move back and forth in some way.  But, neither the Strong nor Weak interaction have anything to say about the structure of an electron or any lepton.  Some other interaction must be at play here.

The combination of all of this add considerably to Universe X's (already substantial) to do list.  However, given the early success of the work on the E&M mechanism perhaps these tasks are not quite as insurmountable as one might fear.

##[Universe X Answers]##[1a] What is the speed of light?

Universe X is filled with a quantized fluid called 'aether'.  Each element of the aether is called an 'aexel'.  Each aexel can communicate with its neighbors.  It takes exactly one 'tic' of time for a signal to move from an aexel to its neighbor.  The 'speed of light' is the translation of a signal at one aexel per tic.

[1b] Why is it not possible to go faster than the speed of light?

It's not possible to go faster than the speed of light because a signal can't move between two aexels faster than a tic and each aexel can only talk to its neighbors; it can't jump over or skip aexels.

[1c] Why does light travel at light speed?

Light travels at light speed because it translates in a straight line, moving a full aexel each tic.

[1d] Why can't things with mass move at light speed?

When a frisbee is flying through the air at a certain speed it is also rotating; as a result some parts of the frisbee are moving faster than the frisbee and other parts are moving slower than the frisbee.  For a frisbee to move at the speed of light some parts of the frisbee would need to move faster than the speed of light, since its not possible to move faster than the speed of light, the frisbee itself would never be able to move at the speed of light.

Sub-lightspeed particles have analogous internal motion and for the same reason can also never move at the speed of light.

[2a] Does God play dice with the Universe?

No.  The seemingly random behavior observed in certain experiments is caused by the (un)known hidden geometry of the aexels at any given point.  The precise location of the aexels at any instance can have an impact in the translation of loops crossing over them.  The observed behavior is statistical not probabilistic.

[2b] Is matter a particle?  Is matter a wave?

Matter is neither a particle or a wave.  It is a stable state loop iterating across a field of aexels.

[3a] Is space 4D? 11D? What does it mean for space to warp?

Space is 3D.  The aether is a (nearly) incompressible fluid.  The 'warping' of space, is simply the contraction of meter sticks at different points due to the flow of aexels at each point, but space and even the aether itself are both flat.

[4a] What is gravity?  What is its mechanism?

Universe X is made up of a quantized fabric called the aether which is made up of aexels.  Gravity, rather than being a force on matter, is a force on the aexels themselves.  The matter sitting upon those aexels simply comes along for the ride.

Perhaps, this force on the aexels is mediated by a incompressible fluid called accelerant that has hyle as its sink and antihyle as its source.  The velocity of the accelerant being promoted to an acceleration of the aexels.

[4b] How can a star attract a photon?

It has been stated that Gravity is a force that is proportional to the product of the masses of two objects.  If a photon has no mass doesn't it follow that it will be unaffected by Gravity?

A Photon (and any loop in Universe X whether it destroys or creates aexels or not) will be affected by gravity because gravity is not a force on matter.  Rather, it is a force on the aexels themselves.  Matter sitting atop this aether simply comes along for the ride.

And as Galileo pointed out long ago that phenomena is in no way a function of the mass of matter being 'pulled' on.

[4c] What is a black hole?

A black hole is any concentration of matter dense enough to have the aexels flowing into it at the speed of light.

[4d] What happens inside of a black hole?

Nothing particularly interesting.  A black hole must be filled with matter all the way to its event horizon, because the escape velocity will always be greatest at the surface.  Both above and below the surface the escape velocity will drop off.  That shell where the escape velocity is equal to c can not have any mass because intrinsic mass loops can't travel at c and can't 'sit' at c.

If a star existed with an escape velocity just below being a black a hole and a tennis ball got tossed into it causing it to cross the line of being a black hole, would anything particularly dramatic happen to the interior of that star?

[4e] Why can't light escape?

Light can't escape a black hole because the aexels are flowing into it at the speed of light.  Light can't go faster than light speed and therefore will never be able to cross the boundary of that shell, like a runner running on a treadmill that is turned up past their max speed.

[4f] What is a gravity wave?  What is waving?

A gravity wave is a compression wave of the density of aexels.  Just as a sound wave is a compression wave of the density of air.  Since the aexels are (nearly) incompressible this is akin to a sound wave in water or perhaps a Newton's Cradle.

[5a] What is time dilation?

In Universe X, 'time' does not dilate.  The rate at which physical systems animate, dilates and it does so because of the delayed round trip time of light speed traveling signals between loops when translating across the aexel field.

[5b] Is there really no special frame of reference?

There IS a special frame of reference; the frame of reference that is not translating across the aexel field at all will animate the fastest and experience no length contraction.  Any other frame will animate slower and experience length contraction entirely as a function of its rate of translation.

[5c] Do two observers both consider their own clocks to be faster?

No.  There will be an observer with a fast clock, an observer with a slow clock and each will know which is which.  And it will entirely be a function of each observer's current rate of translation across the aexel field.

[5d] How does one resolve the twin paradox?

One twin will be translating slower than the other twin on the aexel field.  Whichever twin is translating slower will age more rapidly.

[5e] What is the relationship between Special and General relativity?

Special and general relativity are the exact same phenomena; the translation of systems across an aexel field.  In the case of special relativity a moving system is translating across a static aexel field and in general relativity a static system is translating across a moving aexel field.  But, in both cases the affect simply concerns the translation of a system over an aexel field.

[6a] What is Length Contraction?

Length Contraction is an actual physical phenomena causing loops to sit closer to one another along the direction of translation entirely as a function of the rate of translation.

[6b] Do two observers both consider their own meter sticks to be longer?

No.  Just like in Dilation above, both observers will see a long stick and a short stick and will know which is which; it will be based entirely on each system's current rate of translation across the aexel field.

[6c] Why is the speed of light always invariant?

It is always invariant because length contraction masks changes in the speed of light.  The length of things in the direction of translation is a function of that speed of translation and that change of length will cancel out the change of the speed of light causing the speed of light to always appear to be invariant.

[6d] If length contracts along the direction of travel; when traveling fast will the universe flatten into a pancake?

No. Length contraction only affects systems that are actually translating and are physically connected. The length between any other systems in Universe X will be unaffected.

[7a] What is the expansion of the universe?

The expansion of the universe is the creation of aexels.

[7b] What causes it?

Every loop has an anti loop that is equal and opposite in every way.  Matter loops are sinks to accelerant which results in the squishing of aexels; antimatter loops are sources of accelerant which results in the spawning of new aexels.

[7c] What is Dark Matter?

Dark Matter does not exist.  The phenomena that hints at dark matter is caused by the same entity that causes the phenomena that causes expansion, namely the antimatter particles that are the source of accelerant thereby creating aexels.  That new accelerant pushing on galaxies from the outside, but being mistaken for a pulling on the galaxies from the inside.

[7d] Why does there appear to be more matter than antimatter in the Universe?

Matter ultimately destroys aexels constantly bringing things towards itself.  Antimatter ultimately creates aexels constantly pushing things away from itself.  While matter continually clumps up into increasing large structures.  Antimatter continually spreads out as a dust between the matter clumps.

[8a] What does E=mc² really mean?

There is a single substance in Universe X, termed 'hyle'.  Mass and energy are two separate effects of this hyle.  Energy being the translation of hyle, mass being the hyle's tendency to pull on aexels.  Hyle is conserved and these two effects are always occurring at all times.

[8b] What is its mechanism?

Some times hyle is confined in a particle and bounces back and forth; it's difficult to see the energy in this case.  Some times hyle travels in a straight line and the pulling of aexels is always happening in its wake not internal to itself, making it difficult to see the mass in this case.  But both effects are still happening and always in the same proportion to one another.

[8c] Does a photon have mass?  Where does the mass a star radiates go?

Unlike a proton, a photon does not have internal translation.  Its translation is in a straight-line.  The tugging on the aexels by a photon always occurs in its wake never internal to itself.

So, if mass is the tugging on of aexels then yes it does have mass.  Alternatively if one were to define mass as only the internal tugging on of aexels then no it does not.

The mass of a star radiated out leaves with the photons being spewed by that star.

##[❧ Forward to 3.0]##Since Universe X was first discovered, there have been a handful of additional insights that have been gained, some of which came after the initial development of this app.  Previously, I had just tacked on new articles leaving the old articles largely untouched.

However, with this version I am choosing to rewrite each of the articles based on the complete current understanding of Universe X.  Additionally I have removed 'Odds and Ends' and integrated its discussions into other sections.

Aexels 3.0 also includes 3 new articles and 2 new explorers:

Articles:
- Electromagnetism: New insights have started to shine some light into the mechanism of E&M in Universe X; this contains some early conjecture.
- Discrepancy: Potentially a substantial difference between Universe X and our Universe has been discovered
- Epilogue: A list of about 30 physics questions that tend to be challenging to answer in our universe, are answered for Universe X.

Explorers:
- Dilation: Observe the actual mechanism underpinning 'animation' dilation in Universe X; see exactly when and how it occurs.
- Contraction: While not explaining the mechanism causing length contraction, this simulation viscerally shows the importance of contraction and shows exactly what Lorentz covariance means and what it does not mean in Universe X.

My hope is that Aexels 3.0 represents a significant step forward in the understanding of Universe X, but of course much work remains.  Qualitatively, the big picture is starting to come to light (although it too still has unknowns such as electromagnetism), but quantitatively almost everything still remains to be done.

Hopefully new insights will continue to present themselves and with them the inner working of Universe X will continue to come into focus.

He has honed my understanding of and ability to explain these concepts.  He excels at discussing our own universe; reporting on relevant experiments and their results and to some degree, explaining the math and ideas behind the related physics.

Claude has also helped me learn GPU programming and Apple's Metal API, which I have used for the new Electromagnetism, Gravitation and Outside In simulations as well as retrofitting it into the existing Dilation and Contraction sims.

- Computability: Everything can be explained to and modeled by a computer.  Paradox and randomness are fatal and certainly nothing depends on an observer.
- Parsimony: Nothing is 'counter-intuitive'; declaring an idea such does not suddenly make it immune to reason; anti-parsimony is dead.
- Understanding: 'How' is not a solution; math is knowing, physics is understanding.
- Reduction: Reductions without loss of fidelity strongly indicate truth.
- Locality: Prefer local solutions over distant ones.
- Invariance: The algorithm of the universe is not a function of space or time.
- Balance: Assume balance until proven otherwise.

"blackHole_name" = "Black Holes";
"blackHole_article" = "#[What's Inside of a Black Hole?]#The Floating Leaf article argues that since gravity is not a force a tennis ball falling from infinity is marking the flow of the aexels it is sitting upon themselves.  As such the velocity of the aexels are:

<<BHEq1>>

Which we can plug into the Lorentz factor:

<<BHEq2>>

to calculate the dilation of a system sitting still at a radius r outside of a non-rotating sphere:

<<BHEq3>>

This gives us an intuition that the speed of the aexels is equal to the escape velocity.  For a planet, the escape velocity continues to increase as we drill into the interior.  For a black hole, if the velocity of the aexels at the event horizon is already c, then it would seem the escape velocity would rise above c in the interior (unless it was an entirely hollow shell).

The Kinematics article detailed why teslons can not move at c, but similarly they also can't sit still on aexels traveling at c.  Analogously, edisons can't sit still on aexels traveling greater than c.  It would seem that either all the hyle inside is at the center or it's on the shell.

However, the escape velocity no longer tracks with the rate of aexel flow.  The external Schwarzschild metric no longer applies inside a sphere.

There is however an alternate internal Schwarzschild Metric solved assuming a constant density sphere.  Using this alternate metric we can derive the dilation in the interior of a such sphere:

<<BHEq4>>

We can also calculate the radius of a black hole by setting the escape velocity to c.  <<BHEq5>>
 <<BHEq6>>

Let's now calculate dilation for the interior of a black hole by setting R = r_s.  <<BHEq7>>

The dilation factor ranges from 2 at the center to infinity at the horizon thereby meeting up with the external Schwarzschild metric.  We can rearrange the Lorentz factor to get the aexel velocity as a function of gamma and calculate the flow rate at the center.  <<BHEq8>>

<<BHEq9>>

So, once in the interior the flow rate immediately drops below c again allowing for teslons (and of course edisons) to persist in the interior.

Another thing to note, for any given sphere of mass, the surface of the sphere is the point where the rate of aexel flow is at a maximum.  As soon as one moves out from the surface of the sphere the aexel flow begins to slow.  This fact combined with the fact that no matter, teslon or edison, can sit on aexels flowing at greater than c means that there can be no area inside the event horizon with empty space, the matter must extend until the horizon.

Basically, in a black hole there must be a shell with aexels flowing at c.  The surface of a sphere must be the maximum of aexel flow.  Matter can't sit on aexels flowing at greater than c.  As such there simply can not be any empty space inside the horizon.

##[A Mildly Interesting Aside]##I had always assumed the Earth was close enough to a uniform density sphere that its gravitational field was strongest at its surface.  But, in researching this question I found out that it isn't true.

Here is a plot of the gravitational field of the Earth at r using the PREM model.

According to this model the field strength actually increases until ~0.54 r before it starts quickly falling off.

A physicist develops a theory that A relates to B proportionally.  He tests that theory and confirms he is correct.  Also, while running the experiment, he measures the proportionality constant q.  He then tosses in whatever units are necessary to make the equation work out correctly and is left with:

<<GEq1>>

But, what is q?  Does it have any physical meaning?  Does q have any structure itself?  Might it break down into multiple constants each with their own tangible physical meaning?

Newton's Law of Gravity states that:

<<GEq2>>

But, in Universe X, we have come to realize that Gravity is not a force.  Just as Galileo observed, Gravity is perhaps better described as an acceleration:

<<GEq3>>

In Universe X Gravity is caused by the destruction of aexels by mass; the aexels' crystalline nature causing more aexels to be pulled in resulting in the perceived tug on everything sitting upon those same aexels.

This hints at a natural constant; the rate at which aexels are destroyed per unit of mass per unit of time.  The number of aexels could be represented by a volume of space.  This would result in a constant in MKS of m³/kg/s; volume per kilogram per second.

Out of curiosity, let's look up G.  G is 6.67430(15) x 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg/s².

Interestingly (and perhaps shockingly) G is almost the exact units of our hypothetical natural constant, with just an extra 1/s.  What is this extra 1/s?  Perhaps G is a composite constant with structure.  Let's name our aexel destruction constant G₀.  And let us posit that G is a composite constant that can be written qG₁, where q = 1/1s and G₁ has units m³/kg/s.  <<GEq4>> <<GEq5>>

Now Newton's gravitation becomes:

<<GEq6>>

Breaking the units of this down:

<<GEq7>> <<GEq8>> <<GEq9>>

which is a volume per second; the total \"space\" destroyed per second.

Now we add the 1/r² term,

<<GEq10>>

we get a length per second.  The length of aexels that must be pulled through each point of the shell surrounding the mass.  And in that case this gives us: 
<<GEq11>> <<GEq12>>

Let's integrate:

<<GEq13>>

Perhaps leaving us with a much more physically meaningful version of Newton's Law of Gravitation.

And also perhaps indicating that the mechanism of Gravity was hiding in plain sight for centuries.

What is the 'win condition' here that proves the following:
- basic physical reality: that two observers looking at the same display at the same time at the same place will see the same thing.
- dilation: that the clocks in the two ships will move at different rates.
- reciprocity: that both ships will see the other ship's clock as being dilated.

If the observers read different values off the same display while looking at it at the same time from the same place, then physical reality breaks down.  There is no magic 'relativity of simultaneity' wand coming to the rescue here.

If both clocks show the same value, then dilation breaks down.

If both observers see a fast clock and a slow clock and agree on which is which than reciprocity breaks down.

There is no win condition that confirms all three, only two can be true.  Luckily while there is a multitude of experimental evidence for basic physical reality and much evidence for dilation, there is precisely zero evidence for reciprocity.  Not a single experiment has ever confirmed it.  This makes the choice of which condition to abandon quite easy.

Reciprocity can not be true.

"narwhal_name" = "Narwhal, Walrus and Dolphin";
"narwhal_article" = "#[The Narwhal, the Walrus and the Dolphin]#3 spaceships, the Narwhal, the Walrus and the Dolphin meet in deep space to conduct an experiment concerning length contraction.

Each of these ships is somewhat unique.  The Walrus is a large lumbering ship that while able to get around is not particularly fast.  The Dolphin on the other hand is a very fast and nimble ship that is able to accelerate to half the speed of light in the blink of an eye.  The most unusual is the Narwhal which is just as fast as the Dolphin however it has a large horn protruding from its front end that is one astronomical unit in length (1 AU = the distance from the Earth to the Sun).

{{NWD}}

They bring with them a steel 'AU Stick' that is also one astronomical unit in length.  Once they have all arrived, they arrange themselves as follows:

- The Walrus sits at the origin.  The other two ships calibrate their coordinates such that the Walrus is always at the origin.
- The Dolphin is next to the Walrus preparing to blast down the negative X-Axis.
- The Narwhal is 1 AU away at (1AU, 0, 0) with its horn pointing towards the Walrus at the origin.
- The AU stick is placed so that one end is at the origin and the other is at (1AU, 0, 0).
- There is a beacon at the center of the AU stick which, when ready will flash.  Since the beacon is equidistant to all of the ships, the flash will reach each at the same time.

<<nwd_diag>>

The beacon flashes and when it reaches the ships they all start their stopwatches and both the Dolphin and the Narwhal instantly accelerate to 0.5c in the negative X direction.

At that moment; after the instantaneous acceleration,
- In the Walrus' coordinates, what are the positions of all 3 ships; the tip of the Narwhal's horn and the AU stick?
- In the Narwhal's coordinates, what are the positions of all 3 ships; the tip of the Narwhal's horn and the AU stick?
- How fast is the Narwhal going in the Narwhal frame?
- Are the Narwhal and the Dolphin in the same inertial frame?  Does the distance between them contract?  Does the distance between the Narwhal and the tip of its horn contract?
- What does 'same inertial frame' mean?

This problem can be fairly tricky to deal with in our Universe, however it's quite straightforward in Universe X.  For this problem, in Universe X, let's assume that the Walrus is sitting still in the aether frame and that the aether is static and uniform.

This makes answering the first part fairly straightforward:

In the Walrus frame:
- The Walrus is at (0, 0, 0)
- The Dolphin is at (0, 0, 0)
- The Narwhal is at (1AU, 0, 0) 
- The AU stick has one end at (0, 0, 0) and the other at (1AU, 0, 0)
- The horn is contracted by 1/γ.  γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) = 1/√(1-0.25) = 1/√0.75 ≈ 1.155 so the contracted length is 0.866 AU, putting the tip at 1 - 0.866 =  (0.134 AU, 0, 0)

In the Narwhal frame things are only slightly more complicated.  The Narwhal's meter sticks are now contracted so more of them will fit in between things when measured with them; it still considers its horn to be 1 AU long even though it's only 0.866 AU.  Recall also that the Narwhal has calibrated its coordinates so that the Walrus is at the origin.

In the Narwhal frame:
- The Walrus is at (0, 0, 0)
- The Dolphin is at (0, 0, 0)
- The contracted Narwhal meter stick is 0.866 m long and more will fit in one AU, 1 / 0.866 = 1.155.  So the Narwhal sees itself as being at (1.155 AU, 0, 0)
- The AU stick has one end at (0, 0, 0) and the other at (1.155 AU, 0, 0)
- The Narwhal still considers the horn to be 1AU, so since the Narwhal is at 1.155 AU the tip of the horn must be at (0.155AU, 0, 0)

How fast does the Narwhal think its going?

The Narwhal is traveling at 0.5 c.  But time has slowed for the Narwhal.  A Narwhal second is actually 1.155 seconds long.  Which means it travels 0.5c * 1.155 seconds in a Narwhal second.  But also, its meter stick is contracted.  So, it thinks this distance is even further by another 1.155 factor.  Netting 0.5 c * γ² = 2/3rds the speed of light.

Are the Narwhal and the Dolphin in the same inertial frame?  Does the distance between them contract?  Does the distance between the Narwhal and the tip of its horn contract?

The distance between the Narwhal and the Dolphin does not contract, from the Narwhal's (and Dolphin's) perspective it actually expands but the distance between the Narwhal and the tip of its horn does contract.  Remember why distances contract in Universe X.  They contract because of the ping / pong / photon cloud.  High rates of translation delay and warp the cloud causing the teslons to sit closer together along the direction of translation.

Contraction isn't magic it's a mechanical phenomenon caused by the delayed responses of the pings and pongs.

Since the tip of the horn is connected to the Narwhal as a single object; since they are all part of the same ping / pong cloud; the distances of teslons contained in that cloud will contract.

The Dolphin is not connected to the Narwhal and therefore is part of a separate ping / pong cloud and as a result the distance between the Dolphin and the Narwhal will not contract even though you could say they are in the 'same inertial frame'.

This points to an important classification of the term 'same inertial frame'.  Type 1 are particles connected via a single ping / pong cloud.  As they translate together across the aether their distances will contract.  A type 2 'same inertial frame' could be two isolated systems, such as the Dolphin and the Narwhal that experience the same dilation, experience the same contraction factor and whose contraction axis is aligned.

With this definition actually if the Dolphin were to reverse direction and travel at +0.5c instead of -0.5c, they would still meet the definition of type 2 'same inertial frame' since they would experience the same dilation and the same contraction factor and the axis of contraction would align.  For type 3 'same inertial frame' consider if the Dolphin was moving orthogonal to the Narwhal along the Y axis instead.  Now it has the same dilation, but its contraction axis is no longer aligned.  One might also consider a ship sitting on the surface of a planet with escape velocity 0.5c also having type 3 'same inertial frame'.

So, this gives us 3 classes of 'Same Inertial Frame':

- Type 1: part of a contiguous ping / pong cloud.
- Type 2: isolated , but having the same dilation and contraction factors and aligned contraction axes.
- Type 3: isolated and with same dilation and contraction factors, but with unaligned contraction axes.

"floatingLeaf_name" = "Floating Leaf";
"floatingLeaf_article" = "#[Floating Leaf]#What is the dilation at the surface of a planet?

Dilation is entirely a function of the rate of translation of a system across the aexels.  Therefore, to find the dilation at the surface of a planet one simply needs to figure out the rate that the aexels flow into the planet.

In Universe X, gravity is not a force on matter, but rather a force on the aexels.  Newton's law of Gravitation is empirical, but we can use it to calculate the motion of a tennis ball placed at rest infinitely far from a planet.

Gravity is not a force on matter, it can not directly cause the translation of teslons across the aexels.  It can only pull on the aexels themselves and as such, the motion of the tennis ball will show us the motion of the aexels.  Just as a leaf floating down a river shows us the velocity of the water that is carrying it, the tennis ball floating down to the planet will show us the velocity of the aexels upon which it sits.  Using a little Physics 101 math we can calculate the velocity of the tennis ball when it hits the surface (i.e., the escape velocity):

<<DiscrA>>

This gives us the velocity of the tennis ball at the surface and therefore the velocity of the aexels at the surface.  Any system at rest on the planet will have the aexels flowing through it at that velocity, therefore we can plug it into the dilation equation in order to get the dilation at the surface.

<<DiscrB>>

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the value we arrived at here using a little physical intuition and undergrad math is precisely equal to the dilation at the surface of a planet in our universe that is calculated by solving Einstein's 4x4 tensor with 10 equations and 10 unknowns for a perfect sphere.

"fourClocks_name" = "Four Clocks";
"fourClocks_article" = "#[Four Clocks]#Imagine a lone planet and 4 clocks.  The 4 clocks, W, X, Y and Z are situated as follows:  W sits at infinity, X is falling from infinity at escape velocity and is currently at a point r above the planet, Y is resting on a platform a distance r above the surface and Z is blasting off to infinity at escape velocity also currently at the point r above the planet.

<<4Clocks>>

What is the time dilation experienced by each of the 4 clocks.

Clock W at infinity is not translating at all, so it has no translational velocity and therefore its dilation is 1.

<<DiscrC>>

Clock X is simply floating down with the aexels and similarly not translating at all; its dilation is also equal to 1.

<<DiscrC>>

Clock Y is sitting on the platform above the surface of the planet with the aexels flowing through it towards the planet as described in the Floating Leaf article.  Its dilation can be calculated by plugging the escape velocity at the platform into the dilation equation:

<<DiscrB>>

Clock Z is blasting up from the surface.  The aexels will be moving towards the planet at the escape velocity for r.  The clock itself will be moving away from the planet at that exact same escape velocity in the opposite direction.  Therefore the translational velocity of clock Z will be 2 times that escape velocity.  Plugging that into the dilation equation gives:

<<DiscrE>>

A generalized equation for the dilation of a system moving in such a scenario can be described.  One simply needs to calculate the net translational velocity of the system and plug that into the dilation equation.  The net translational velocity will simply be the length of the escape velocity vector minus the system's velocity vector; giving:

<<DiscrF>>

Let's now consider the exact same thought experiment in our Universe.  In our universe the behavior of just such a system is described by the Schwarzschild metric which is a solution to Einstein's equations for a non-rotating sphere.

There is a constant of motion for an inertial observer in the Schwarzschild metric:

<<DiscrG>>

For a clock starting from rest at infinity, energy will entirely be due to its intrinsic mass and therefore will be equal to mc².  Using this we can calculate gamma:

<<DiscrH>>

In our universe the dilation of such a system is never a function of the direction of the velocity vector.  The dilation of the falling clock and the blasting off clock is exactly the same.

For our universe the time dilation of the 4 clocks is as follows:

Clock W, r goes to infinity, 1/r goes to 0 and gamma goes to 1.

<<DiscrD>>

Clock X

<<DiscrI>>

Clock Y, as mentioned previously matches the dilation of Clock Y in Universe X.

<<DiscrB>>

Clock Z

<<DiscrI>>

The dilation of clocks W and Y match in the two universes; the dilation of clock X and Z do not.  And more so, for any given r,

Universe X:
    W = X < Y < Z

Our Universe
    W < Y < X = Z

This is a rather substantial deviation in the two universes.  How could such a discrepancy arise?

Recall in the Chronos article it was shown that Reciprocity could not possibly be true.

One of the first steps in the derivation of Einstein's field equations is the definition of ds² = c²dt² - dx² - dy² - dz² and to note that because of reciprocity this term is a constant for all frames.  But, if reciprocity is false, ds² invariance is false.

The metric did, however, get the dilation correct for clocks W and Y, even if it was wrong for clocks X and Z.  It worked for the static clocks, but not for the translating ones.  The Reciprocity assumption broke the calculation for moving systems.

The 'constant of motion' is what introduces ds² invariance and consequently throws things off the tracks.

One might also note that Einstein's General Relativity has only ever been experimentally tested using static systems.

Beyond all this there may be something else being illustrated here.  Consider the following again:

    W = X

This hints at a potentially new, much stronger equivalence principle, that a system in free fall is precisely equivalent to a system in flat space.  This concept is further explored in the Gravity II article.

<<magnetism_diag>>

To the boys in the pickup truck, as the football moves back and forth between them; the axis of the football aligns with the direction of travel.  To the boy on the side of the road, the football zigzags diagonally down the road back and forth.  The axis of the football forms an angle with the direction of travel.

For the pings and pongs (and photons) of Universe X, the cupola vector is akin to the axis of the football; all frames see the cupola pointing in the same direction.  But the translation vector of the particle itself is frame dependent, some frames will see the cupola aligned with the frame dependent translation vector and other will not.

Each of these particles has three relevant vectors: the cupola, the absolute frame translation vector and the frame dependent translation vector.  The absolute frame translation vector is the translation vector across the aether.  The frame dependent translation vector is the translation vector relative to a specific frame.  The cupola is the stored property of the particle described in the Electromagnetism article.

{{MGImg1}} **This diagram shows the pings radiating out from a teslon.  The teslon is translating at 0.7c to the right.  The white vectors represent the ping's translation vectors from the teslon's frame of reference.  The black vectors represent the ping's translation from the aether's frame of reference.  The axis of the football represents the cupola vector.**

When the cupola and the frame dependent translation vectors align, the particle appears to be purely electrical.  As we shift frames and an angle between the frame dependent translation vector and the cupola develops that previously purely electrical ping begins to take on a magnetic component.

The frame dependent translation vector and the cupola define a plane.  The B field is perpendicular to that plane.  Once the Lorentz force is applied by the B field, the force itself is directed back to the exact same plane as defined by the cupola and the frame dependent translation vector.  The Lorentz force is not a perpendicular force.  The B field is actually just a mathematical concatenation of the two more fundamental vectors.
##[What Is Up With Curl?]##When trying to wrap one's head around Maxwell's Equations, Gauss' equations seems fairly intuitive.  It is simply a description of the flow of a conserved quantity.  But, where does curl come from?  Why is there this rotational dynamic?  What is swirling?

Consider a wire with charges flowing down it.  The charges are sending out pings.  These pings have cupolas aligned with the frame dependent translation vectors from the charge's frame (like our pickup truck football players).  But, in the lab frame the cupola and the frame dependent translation vector of the pings are unaligned.  Each ping defines a plane that includes the wire.  The cupola vectors form a 'skirt' around the wire.  There is nothing rotating, there is nothing swirling.

<<MGImg2>>  The rotation only arises when you cross the frame dependent translation vector with the cupola which then creates a circle because of the perpendicular nature of the cross product.  The swirl is not physical; it's entirely mathematical.
##[Next Steps]##Relative to other topics in Physics, electricity and magnetism are rather quite accessible.  Experiments can be performed with modest equipment.  The amount of experimental data is massive.  The math is fairly straightforward.

The Universe X mechanisms described here may be interesting and are fairly easy to model.  The question is, can they recreate the experimental data and math of electromagnetism.  Another question is at what point do the relatively straightforward mechanisms of E&M give way to the mechanisms of quantum mechanics.  For example:

 - Can the same dynamics be calculated from multiple frames?
 - Can the E and B field transforms be replicated using these mechanisms?
 - Can Ampere's current force be replicated mathematically and / or via simulation?
 - Can Faraday's law be replicated mathematically and / or via simulation?
 - Can the electromagnetic wave be replicated?
 - Can the transfer of energy and momentum be modeled?

At best these mechanisms hint at being qualitatively compatible, but obviously that is entirely insufficient.  They must be shown to be quantitatively compatible also.

And of course the quantized nature of the aexels themselves would explain many of the observed aspects of Quantum Mechanics.

However with a better understanding of Bell's argument, it became apparent there was a more fundamental discrepancy between Universe X and Quantum Mechanics. This led me to a paper by Dutch Physicist Gerard 't Hooft titled \"Explicit construction of Local Hidden Variables for any quantum theory up to any desired accuracy\". In his paper Professor 't Hooft argues that contrary to Bell that

Game of Life

In 1970, British Mathematician, John Conway devised the cellular automaton known as the Game of Life.  Conway was attempting to create a much simpler version of a system previously devised by John von Neumann in the 1940s.

The rules to Conway's Game of Life are fairly straightforward: Take a plane made up of square cells.  Each cell can either be on or off.  Each cell has 8 neighbors, the 8 cells directly surrounding it.  If two of a cell's neighbors are 'on' then the cell's state is unchanged.  If three of the cell's neighbors are 'on' then the cell's state is turned / remains on.  In all other cases the cell's state is turned / remains off.

Some things to look for:

- Look for static patterns (called still lifes).  These are any shapes that repeat each step, i.e., stay exactly the same each step.  One common still life is the 'block', which is 4 pixels situated in a square.

- Look for any dynamic patterns.  The most common dynamic pattern is a bar 3 cells long.  It will continually iterate between horizontal and vertical.  This loop is called a 'blinker'.  The blinker is by far the most common dynamic pattern.  There are a handful of other relatively common 2 step loops, such as 'beacons' and 'frogs'.

- About once every few runs a rather large 3 step loop called a 'pulsar' will develop.  In some cases a half pulsar will develop on the edge of the world.

- Perhaps the most famous loop is called the 'glider'.  The glider is a fairly common 4 step pattern, that has one important distinction from the above loops.  The glider is a translating pattern, which is to say it moves across the plane.

For the purpose of Universe X there are a number of important qualitative concepts illustrated by Conway's Game of Life that can be gleaned fairly quickly.  However, a shockingly large amount of research has been done into Conway's Game of Life and a few minutes with Google can open up this massive body of work to enable further research, if so desired.

And while perhaps not quite as fruitful as Game of Life in generating complex systems, it does nicely illustrate a number of important qualitative concepts, in addition to making pretty cool pictures.

A cyclic cellular automaton again makes use of a plane tiled with square cells.  Each cell can be in one of n possible states (in this case 12) and has 4 neighbors; the cells directly above, below, left and right of it.

If any of the neighboring cells is in a state that is one more than the current cell (or 0 for a cell of state n-1), then the cell will be eaten and take on the state of the neighboring cell.  A cell can eat and be eaten in the same time step.  This allows loops to form that contain each of the n states.  These loops will create spirals called demons.

Using the Oovium visual programming language it is possible to define custom cellular automata.

Double tapping on an empty area of the Oovium panel will create a new bubble.  By default an instance bubble will be created that allows the user to enter in a number or a calculation.  Using the bubble maker in the upper right of the Oovium panel, one can also create an IfBub which is a visual conditional or a MechBub which enables the creation of custom functions.

The workspace of Oovium is called an 'aether' (Oovium was created well before Universe X was discovered and the usage of the term aether is just a coincidence).  By default, each of the aethers in the automata lab are pre populated with an AutoBub, which allows one to define their own cellular automata.

The top area of the AutoBub represents a cell and its neighbors' current state: the neighborhood.  The bottom area represents the cell's new state which should be a calculation based on the current state of the neighborhood.

There is also a properties button which will allow for the number of states to be defined (between 2 and 32) and also allow for various colors to be selected for the different states.

More about learning how to use the Oovium visual programming language including tutorial videos can be found at oovium.com.  The full Oovium visual programming language is available for iPad and iPhone in the AppStore and for Mac in the Mac AppStore.

"kinematicsLab_article" = "Kinematics Lab

Motion in our own universe can be described entirely by a vector which represents the velocity of a given object.  In Universe X, however there are two distinct forms of motion: translation across the aether and the flow of the aether itself.  In order to fully describe motion in Universe X, one must know both the translating vector and the aethereal flow vector, as well as the density and geometry of the aexels themselves.

This lab allows us to compare the motion of our Universe with that of Universe X.  The lab models an object frictionlessly moving inside a 2 dimensional box, elastically bouncing off the walls.

For Universe X, the model uses a regular hexagonal tiling to represent the aether.  The translational \"velocity\" vector represents the percent chance that the object will move to an adjacent cell each time step from 0 to 100 percent.  If the vector falls between two faces the chance of moving to either face is weighted based on the direction of the vector.  In this way motion in any arbitrary direction, not just the 6 cardinal directions can be achieved.  This random walk model is known as a Feynman checkerboard.

Perhaps the first thing one might note when comparing the two models is that motion in the Universe X model is quite jerky as opposed to the smooth motion of the model for our Universe.  However, the Universe X model is a statistical model and we are looking at both large aexels and large time steps.  As the density of aexels and time steps increase the motion will continually get more and more smooth until it would become difficult to differentiate the motion of the two systems.

In looking at the Universe X model there are two important things to note.  The first is that during collisions there can be a transfer between translating motion and flow motion.  For example, if we stop the translating motion entirely and point the aether directly downward (see Experiment B).  The particle will smoothly flow down along with the aether.  However, once the particle hits the bottom wall, the flow motion will be converted into twice the translating motion upwards, which when added to the flow motion will cause the object to move upwards at (statistically) the same velocity with which it moved downwards.

The other thing to note then is that as the density of aexels and time steps increases, the flow of the aether is irrelevant to the dynamics of the system.  I.e., a system where there is no aethereal flow will behave statistically the same as one in which there is an aethereal flow.

Although it is the case that God plays dice with our Universe, it is an open question as to whether God plays dice with Universe X.  In this situation, it was necessary for the model to employ a random number generator in order to model the motion.  Arbitrary directions of translation could not be achieved without this randomness.  However, this does not imply that such randomness is a necessary component of Universe X.

In this case the aether is modeled simplistically with regular 2 dimensional hexagons.  However, one could imagine the actual distribution of 3 dimensional aexels in Universe X as being quite irregular.  Potentially an entirely deterministic way of jumping from aexel to aexel would appear random due to the unknown hidden variables which are the geometry of the aexels themselves.

"aetherLab_article" = "Aether Lab

Note: In addition to the new experiments a number of interactive abilities have been added:

- Aexels can now be dragged around.
- An Aexel can be locked in place by tapping on it.
- A new Aexel can be created by tapping on empty space.
- An Aexel can be destroyed by double tapping on it.

This is an attempt to model the Aexels themselves.  Certainly, the ideal will be to create a quantitative model, however there are way too many open questions to attempt that currently.  As such the goal at this point is to create a qualitative model of Universe X and its aexels.  The hope being to create a visceral picture of Universe X; a thousand words per frame at 60 frames per second.

This first model attempts to recreate the dynamics of the aexel field itself, the aether.  In this case the aexels can create bonds between each other.  The bonds have a relaxation distance; if they are too close they will push apart, too far they will pull together.  However, aexels that are double the relaxation distance from one another can not create bonds and if a bond already exists between them it will snap.

This model is entirely two dimensional and bonds can not cross one another.  When two bonds cross, the shorter bond will take precedence and snap the longer bond.  The aexels themselves have no concept of momentum; each bond creates a push or pull in the direction of the bond proportional to the distance from relaxation.  The aexel then jumps slightly in the direction of the sum of the pushes and pulls.

In this lab there are ten preset experiments; the first three differ only in the number of aexels and the relaxation distance.  The 4th experiment implements Conway’s Game of Life on top of the dynamic lattice, giving a flavor of the possible interplay between the aexels and the loops sitting upon them.  The 5th through 9th experiments start the aexels out in various initial shapes.  The 10th is simply a blank sandbox that allows users to create whatever systems they want.

Currently, this model does a respectable job of healing holes in the aether fabric.  The next step is to attempt to model gravity itself.  This will require a mechanism for creating and destroying aexels based on the loops on top.  In order to succeed the fabric probably needs to be even better at healing itself and realistically there will need to be a lot more aexels.  The key to adding more aexels will be continually increasing the performance of the algorithms being used here.

"gravityLab_article" = "The Gravity simulation is similar to the OutsideIn simulation, but with free flowing aexels and the squish mechanism implemented.

Once the pressure on an aexel crosses a specific threshold it squishes and disappears entirely.  This enables the OutsideIn concept without violating Gauss and does so by removing the assumption that the destruction of aexels occurs locally.

At the moment the flow inward is simply applied as a 1/r² force applied directly to the aexels.  Early attempts at implementing the accelerant have been made, but the granularity of the aexels is currently too coarse effectively demonstrate the flow elegantly.

There are three controls in this simulation:
 - color bonds will color stressed bonds as orange
 - squish can toggle the squish mechanism
 - recycle will add 'dark energy' to the outside causing new aexels to form and allowing the simulation to run in steady state.

In subsequent versions I will attempt to dramatically increase the aexel count in order to create a finer grained aether.  This will hopefully enable a more elegant implementation of accelerant and allow for a moon to orbit the planet.

"dilationLab_article" = "Dilation Lab

Cheat Sheet:
- Play / Pause: to pause and unpause the simulation
- Reset: to clear the simulation and restart with current settings
- Speed of Light: define the speed of light in points (pixels) per second.
- Velocity: the translation velocity of the teslons (blue) across the aexels as a percent of c.
- Auto: turns on an auto-pulse which sends out green edisons from the source every 2 seconds.
- Tails: turns on tails for the edisons which illustrate their direction of translation across the aexel field.
- Fixed: Turns on/off the fixed camera that moves with the aexels instead of the teslons.  (although jumps ahead when the teslon leaves the screen.)
- Pulse: Manually sends out a pulse of green edisons from the source blue teslon.

In our Universe 'Time Dilation' is a very magical phenomena.  'Time' itself is dilating.  There are no special frames of reference and the observations of different systems is a function of the observers themselves rather than being based on fundamental physical processes.  The Twin paradox is an actual paradox in our Universe.

In Universe X however, dilation is not magical at all.  First of all, time does not dilate, but rather it's the rate at which physical systems animate, that dilates.  Dilation is in no way dependent on an observer; each system experiences a specific dilation entirely a function of it's rate of translation across the aexel field.

This dilation in Universe X has a physical basis; it is caused by the slow down of edison (loops that move at the speed of light) messengers traveling between the teslons (loops that move at less than the speed of light).

This laboratory gives a visceral description of the process of dilation in Universe X.  As the rate of translation of a system of teslons (the blue circles) increases the amount of time it takes a signal to move back and forth increases.

This simulation knows nothing about the equations of relativity.  It simply shows teslons moving at a velocity v as a percent of c (as specified by the user) and edisons moving at velocity c.  From these simple rules 'dilation' naturally arises.

In playing with the simulation try to observe the increased distance that must be traveled between the teslons as the rate of translation increases.  Be particularly cognizant of the direction of translation of edisons as they move back and forth.

Note:
In this simulation the individual aexels are not being modeled, only the flow of the aexel field in general.  Electromagnetic phenomena as being illustrated here works at a much larger scale than the aexels and as such the continuous approximation is a fair representation of reality.  For example, if each aexel were one nanometer across (rather than the Planck length), then the radius of a proton centered on the Sun would extend nearly halfway to Venus.

"contractionLab_article" = "Contraction Lab

Cheat Sheet:
- Play / Pause: to pause and unpause the simulation
- Reset: to clear the simulation and restart with current settings
- Speed of Light: define the speed of light in points (pixels) per second.
- Velocity: the translation velocity of the teslons (blue) across the aexels as a percent of c.
- Auto: turns on an auto-pulse which sends out green edisons from the source every 2 seconds.
- Tails: turns on tails for the edisons which illustrate their direction of translation across the aexel field.
- Contract: Turns on/off the length contraction.  (I.e., Makes the horizontal and vertical particles equidistant from the source.)
- Pulse: Manually sends out a pulse of green edisons from the source blue teslon.

The Contraction lab is very similar to the Dilation lab, but also includes a horizontal teslon in addition to the previous vertical and source teslons.

This lab does not attempt to explain the mechanism of length contraction.  However, this lab does further illustrate the mechanism underpinning relativity in Universe X and how Lorentz covariance continues to hold.

Similar to 'Time Dilation', 'Length Contraction' in our Universe is described as being an observational phenomena highly dependent on the frame of reference of the observer.  And like 'Time Dilation' there is no special frame of reference, observers always see their meter sticks as being longest.

However, just as in the dilation section, contraction in Universe X is a real physical phenomenon and is a direct result of the rate of translation across the aexel field.

In our Universe there is a notion called Lorentz Covariance which says that the speed of light is the same in all directions for all time frames.  In Universe X, however, not only is the speed of light not the same, it's almost always different, not just for people in different frames, but along almost any two directions of a single frame (unless the frame isn't translating at all.)

However, even though the speed of light is always changing, Lorentz Covariance holds in Universe X just as it does in our Universe and it does so because of the length contraction.

In Universe X, light (or any edison) always travels at one aexel per tic; previously we defined 1 aexel / tic = speed of light.  The Contraction simulation illustrates another way in which 'light always travels at the speed of light'.  Any time a signal is sent out in any direction, it will always return at the exact same time from all directions as a result of length contraction, even though the velocity of the light can vary greatly in each of the directions and vary on its way out compared to its return trip.

Rather than saying that 'light always travels at the speed of light' for all inertial frames, It would perhaps be more accurate to say that the time of any roundtrip journey between two points of light over a given distance is a constant.

This lab perhaps works best with 'auto' turned off and manually pulsing instead.  In this way it is possible to compare the roundtrip duration of the vertical light and the horizontal light.

Certainly, when the velocity of the system of teslons is 0, the light returns at the exact same moment in all directions.  But, watch as the system is sped up to 10, 20, 50, 70, 90 and 99% of the speed of light.  In all of these cases each signal returns back to the source at the exact same moment no matter the rate of translation, whether moving towards or moving away from the horizontal loop.

Next turn off contraction, forcing the horizontal particle to be equidistant from the source as the vertical one.  Now it is possible to see that the edison messengers are returning at different times.  Without, length contraction, Lorentz Covariance would no longer hold.

One of the complications in this conversation and really any topics related to Universe X is the notion of distance.  In our Universe, distance is rather straight forward.  However, in Universe X, there are potentially 3 different notions of distance.

- In Universe X, space is just an empty box filled with quantized aether.  Therefore between any two points there exists a basic cartesian distance between them.  But, since everything in the universe happens in the context of the aexels, there are no natural land marks or 'space' rulers available to measure this type of distance; it can only be inferred from other hints.
- The next potential definition of distance would be to simply count the number of aexels between two points.  Since aexels can vary in density this concept of distance may not track with the cartesian concept.  Similar to the 'space' definition above there isn't a (known) way to directly measure the number of aexels between two points.
- The last potential definition of distance would be measure the time it takes light to travel to and from two points.  This definition has the massive advantage of being able to be measured.  However, unlike the previous two definitions because of length contraction this definition is not universal for all observers.

Distance is a tricky concept to get a handle on in Universe X.  Time is a similarly tricky concept to get a handle on.  Velocity being distance / time makes it perhaps doubly tricky to get a handle on and as a result the notion of the \"speed of light\" can be a bit nebulous.

"electromagnetismLab_article" = "The Electromagnetism simulation models the pings and pongs and their cupola vector.

When fully rendered each ping and pong is modeled as an ellipse (or football) pointing in the direction of the cupola.  It also has a white line representing the frame dependent translation vector and a black line representing the absolute frame translation vector.

The aether frame toggle will turn on an aether frame view on the bottom of the screen with a camera that tracks with the aether frame instead of the translation frame.  In the aether frame since the frame is the aether the frame dependent and absolute translation vectors are the same, so only the white lines will appear (the black lines be hidden underneath).

Auto volley will periodically send out a volley of pings based on the 'time steps per volley' setting.

Camera walls will bounce the particles if they exit outside the camera frames view port.

The pings and pongs settings will toggle between the full rendering of each and a mini rendering of just a tiny football without the translation vectors E and B shading.

When fully rendered each pong will be shaded based on the proportion of electric and magnetic it represents in the viewed frame.  This is calculated by crossing the cupola with the frame dependent translation vector (the angle of ellipse with the white line).

Pure E pongs will be represented as red, pure B pongs as blue and anything in between will be some gradient of the two colors.  This becomes particularly apparent if you slide the aether velocity back and forth violently.





";

"insideOutLab_article" = "The InsideOut simulation is based on the premise that the aether is a pool of fluid with a sink in the middle that causes fluid from the next ring over to flow inward.

This simulation is very simple, perhaps more of an illustration than a simulation.

Every unit of time the amount of fluid removed from each cylinder is equal to the amount fluid removed from the center cylinder and as such falls of at 1/r in the 2D case modeled here, which would be 1/r² in 3D.

Unlike the E&M case with pings where the amount of existing pings falls off at 1/r², in this case the amount of *missing* fluid falls at 1/r².

Because of this flow the current of fluid flow from each cylinder to the next inner cylinder is also 1/r in the 2D case (1/r² in the 3D case).

It had long been the basic premise of Universe X that aexel flow was somehow operating akin to this model, but of course there were nagging issues that made direct correspondence challenging.

And in particular it seemed to not meet up with the OutsideIn model which had a particularly strong empirical underpinning in being tied to the dilation at every point in space.  More detail is explored in that simulation.





";

"outsideInLab_article" = "The OutsideIn simulation starts from the premise that the dilation at any radius r, is an indication of the rate of translation of the aexels at that point.

Consider 5 airport moving sidewalks situated directly one after another.  Each people mover is moving 5 mph faster than the previous one.  You get on the first and feel a force pulling you forward.  You transfer from the 5 mph to the 10mph one and feel the exact same force pulling you forward.  You feel this same acceleration each time you move between the moving sidewalks.

Now add an additional 4 moving sidewalks each now slowing down by 5 mph.  Now the force you feel in transferring from one sidewalk to the next is reversed.

This simulation is analogous.  Each ring is a fixed velocity radially moving sidewalk.  An acceleration (change of velocity) is applied when ever moving between two rings equal to the difference in their velocities.

This simple mechanisms results in a fairly accurate qualitative gravitational force.

One difference between these rings and a moving sidewalk however, is that moons move frictionlessly through space as opposed to the moving sidewalks that rely on friction in order to impart the acceleration.

Double clicking / tapping on the simulation will add a new moon.  If you double tap repeatedly in the same spot, you can create a long line of moons and see the 'curvature' of its orbit.

BUBBLES:
- IfBub : A visual conditional that can be used instead of the in-bubble 'if' function.  Aside from its visual representation, it also has the advantage of only evalutating the appropriate resultant.  This makes the IfBub very useful in creating recursive functions without needing to use the Function data type.

- TailBub : A new type of a MechBub specifically designed for creating recursive functions, greatly simplifing the ability to create loops.  The TailBub's visual structure guides the user in creating a tail call optimized recursion which has performance advantages over MechBub recursion, but more importantly eliminates the 500 loop limit of the MechBub.  (The TailBub will process for up to 1 second, which allow for signficantly more iterations)

- CronBub : Allows for the creation of a timer that increments its value periodically based on input parameters.  The utility of the CronBub, is perhaps a bit limited at this point, but it will become an essential tool for modeling and animating with the arrival of the 2nd aspect of Oovium.

- TypeBub : Allows for the mapping of entities and relationships.  Currently, the TypeBub is not integrated with the other bubble types of Oovium and is a faint shadow of it's ultimate functionality.  However, it has been slipped into this version both as a preview of future attractions and because even in it's current form, it can be useful in creating some simple diagrams.

FUNCTIONS:
- [!,&,|] - the 'not' !, 'and' & and 'or' | operators have been added to the Lexicon

- In conjunction with the conversion of Oovium to OS X, once again massive under-the-cover refactoring has occurred with this version, including the conversion to the ARC memory model, a revamp of the Hover mechanism, some tweaks to the Math engine and major restructing of the Bubble system to allow for easier creation of new Bubbles, although more work is still needed with that.";

The workspace of Oovium is an arbitrarily large 2 dimensional plane that allows users to place bubbles upon it.  This plane is referred to as the Aether.

Anchoring is holding the Aether still with one finger while performing another action with a different finger.  These gestures are:

MOVE BUBBLE [Anchor+Drag:bubble]
Anchor with one finger, then drag a bubble with another.  The more fingers that you use, the more bubbles you can drag around.

CONTEXT MENU [Anchor+Tap:bubble]
Anchor with one finger and tap a bubble with another.  This will bring up a context menu for the bubble that will allow you to perform additional actions to the bubble, such as Label and Delete.

LASSO [Anchor+Drag:aether]
Anchor with one finger and drag another finger on empty space.  A yellow path will begin to render along the path of your second finger.  You will be able to select multiple Bubbles and then move them as a group or perform relevant context menu actions on all of them.

As such, I have decided to create this new alternative path which will detail the path of discovery.  This will catalog the order in which insights were gained and the motivating factors that brought each of those insights about.  Any new insights that occur can then be easily tacked onto the bottom.

It is not my intention for this path to contain simulations, but in the case of Squish, I think it makes sense to include the InsideOut and OutsideIn sims.  Both of these provisional simulations were developed in an attempt to reconcile the two apparently contradictory concepts of gravity.

They were instrumental in helping me arrive at the Squish concept, which I was able to implement within the Gravity simulation.  This new simulation overrides these two provisional simulations, as such, I think it appropriate to place those overridden simulations here.

The articles on this path will tend to be less formal and more personal in order to give more context into my thinking.  My hope is that some users will find these articles to be a more accessible description of Universe X and that the articles will make my thought processes more transparent.

As such, let's head down the path...

"expansion_article" = "#[Expansion of the Universe]#I had left school with an erroneous understanding of what the phrase 'Expansion of the Universe' actually meant.  I held the grenade model of expansion; that at some point in time all matter was at a single point that exploded spewing mass into open space with the domain of that mass continually 'expanding'.

Eventually I found the excellent 'Metric Expansion of Space' article on Wikipedia and came to understand what 'Expansion of the Universe' actually meant.  Namely, that the distance between galaxies was increasing faster than the sum of their velocities.

I found that fact to be entirely fantastical; I couldn't see how it could possibly be true.  How could objects get further apart from one another without increasing their velocity?  I challenged myself to stop trying to understand it with my physics brain and instead try to understand it using my programmer brain: \"If you wanted to program a universe that worked this way how would you do it?\"

I imagined a checkerboard with checkers on opposite sides of the board.  The checkers could move from space to space and increase the distance between themselves, but what if we chop the board in half and start adding new spaces in the middle of the old.  Now the checkers are further apart without having moved from their current space; without having added energy to the checkers themselves.

With that image I started to warm to the idea of expansion.  So much so, that I wondered if there was perhaps some physical reality behind this model.  Once I began to entertain that thought a number of things that previously made no sense suddenly snapped into place.

If a checker could only move one space per turn then there was a maximum speed at which the checker could translate across the board.  Instantly, the speed of light limitation of the universe made sense; there was a precise and easily understood mechanism behind it.

I then imagined these spaces as potentially being compressible and suddenly the 'warping of space' for the first time made sense, although it was more of a smooshing of space, but an easily visualizable smooshing that could entirely occur in three dimensions.

I imagined a spinning object translating across the board with some of its internal components translating faster than its net speed and others slower.  If none of the components can travel faster than the speed of light then the net translation can never be equal to the speed of light.  At once the reason why particles with mass can never travel at the speed of light made sense.

I also imagined that somehow this internal motion could be delayed by the translation of an object across these spaces.  The faster the translation the more delayed the dynamics of the translating system.  And with this early thought 'time dilation' might make sense although the exact mechanism was not yet clear.

This sudden clarity on numerous previously mysterious concepts implanted the seed of Universe X in my brain, which I have found difficult to eradicate ever since.

"escaping_article" = "#[Preventing Light from Escaping from a Black Hole]#A few weeks after my initial insight, I had my first additional breakthrough.  This new discovery followed a pattern that has repeated many times since and hopefully will continue to do so into the future.  Namely, I discovered a 'fatal' flaw which indicated that the concept couldn't possibly be true and then gained an entirely new understanding once I fixed it.

The one fact I knew about black holes and really the thing that makes a black hole, a black hole, is that light can not escape from it.  I pondered this:

\"If there is a quantized aether (let's call that quanta an 'aexel') no matter how dense those aexels are, in and around a black hole, it would seem eventually light traveling one aexel per tic would escape.  Perhaps this idea doesn't work at all.\"

And with that, for the first time, I felt that perhaps I had found a fatal flaw.  But, I hadn't totally given up:

\"What if the aexels are flowing into the black hole at the speed of light?  That could keep the light trapped.  But, the density of the aexels inside just continues to increase forever?  That seems highly unlikely.

Perhaps something inside the black hole is actually destroying the aexels.  In that case, the flow of aexels inward at c or greater would trap light while also keeping the density of aexels inside constant.

But, is there something magical about a black hole that gives it the ability to destroy aexels?  It seems unlikely that one moment it's just a really big star and then after throwing in one last tennis ball thereby converting it into a black hole, it suddenly starts destroying aexels.

Perhaps there is nothing magical about a black hole.

What if it's not black holes that destroy aexels, but rather mass that destroys them?  If it's mass that destroys aexels perhaps this is the very mechanism underpinning gravity itself.\"

And with that an important new insight was gleaned; a potential mechanism for gravity.

At that point I wanted to try to understand this idea mathematically which led to two substantial calculations.  The first calculation indicated a severe problem with the idea; so severe that I concluded the whole idea was dead (again).  The second calculation, however, was so compelling I just couldn't abandon the idea yet.

Recall that the entire motivation of this concept was the desire to create a mechanism that allowed for the adding of space without impacting the velocity of matter that sits upon it; without adding energy to the system; without applying a force.
 Similarly, if gravity is simply the destruction of those aexels, that too should have no direct impact on an object's rate of translation over the aexels.

When an object falls from infinity there is no force acting upon it; nothing is causing it to translate.  Its motion must be entirely because of the flow of the aexels themselves, like a leaf floating down a stream.  As such we can use classical mechanics to calculate the velocity of a tennis ball falling from infinity which will in turn tell us the velocity of the aexels it is sitting upon.  That velocity of course, is just the escape velocity.

If mass destroys aexels locally then the aexels must be conserved in areas outside of the mass.  The flux of aexels through any shell around a mass is the surface area of the shell times the escape velocity:

<<EscEq1>>

This equation, however, clearly indicates that the flux is dependent on r, as opposed to being a constant as required by Gauss' law.  At first and for some time this seemed to be a definitive result that indicated that this idea could not work.  I decided to abandon the concept entirely.

A few days later after mostly putting the concept aside I had a small thought.  If the aexels are flowing at the escape velocity inwards I should be able to just plug the escape velocity into the Lorentz transform to get the dilation at the surface of a planet.  I performed the simple calculation:

<<EscEq2>>

<<EscEq3>>

I then looked up what the actual answer was in Wikipedia.  It was quite shocking seeing the precise formula I had just derived myself without the use of any tensor calculus or the solving of any 10-function PDEs.

If this idea was wrong, how could I have just used it to arrive at this precise calculation?

After this I reconsidered my flux calculation and realized that I had neglected to consider density variations of the aexels as you got closer to the source.  I had no idea what the density at any r would be and figured perhaps whatever that density was precisely balanced the issues created by Gauss.  I then decided to continue on with the idea and added this Gauss issue to my todo list for the future.

The Gauss problem ended up persisting for a great length of time and with smaller additional issues compounding it.  The realization that density was not going to save me here and the ultimate resolution didn't occur until much later as detailed in the 'Squish' article.

Of course all of these musings were happening in the context of the original motivating issue: trying to understand the 'Expansion of the Universe'.  I had some notion of some thing adding spaces in the middle of our checkerboard, but no idea what that thing might be.

Once I came to understand the interplay between mass and the destruction of aexels, it was no great leap to consider that since matter was destroying aexels, antimatter, being equal and opposite in every way, must be creating them.  And while matter would tend to clump up into planets and stars and galaxies, antimatter would tend to spread out as a diffuse dust always pushing things away from it, populating the areas between galaxies and continually adding new aexels to the universe and of course at the same time, red-shifting any light that passed through it.

And with that, the baryogenesis problem was solved.  The reason why we see lots of matter and very little antimatter was simply because matter tends to clump up and form bright stars and galaxies while antimatter diffuses into an invisible dust.

"covariance_article" = "#[Lorentz Covariance]#The initial insights of Universe X had made numerous aspects of physics make sense for the first time, but of course much mystery remained, even within Relativity.  About a year went by before the next innovation.

It was still an open question as to whether Universe X was really saying anything new or just saying the same thing a different way.  I began to look for ways to differentiate Universe X from 'our universe'.

One of my first thoughts was to look at the flow of aexels directly into the Earth.  Because the flow was directly vertical, it made sense that Michelson and Morley hadn't detected an aether running tangentially along the surface.  Perhaps, if they had compared the speed of light running vertically to the speed of light running horizontally they would have found their discrepancy.

I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out how to run such an experiment, which for various reasons is actually quite technically challenging even with cutting edge modern equipment.  Ultimately, however, such an experiment was irrelevant.  The vertical MMX would return the same null result as the horizontal version did.

I had begun to pin down the geometry and math of signals bouncing back and forth across the aexels.  At first I worked on the case where two objects are situated orthogonal to the direction of translation:

<<DilaSketch>>

Which resulted in the familiar Lorentz factor.

I then considered the case where objects were situated parallel to the direction of translation:  <<ContraSketch>> 
I found that whether the target was leading or trailing the source, the time delay was γ², which of course didn't match the orthogonal case's delay of γ.  Only after contracting all lengths in the direction of translation did the signal delay match.

This meant that it wasn't the constancy of the speed of light that caused the MMX to return a null result.  Rather, it was because of length contraction that precisely masked the flow of the aexels.  And with that realization, length contraction was incorporated into Universe X while a possible avenue of differentiation was closed.

Additionally, with these calculations, the mechanism underpinning dilation and contraction became much better understood and much more rigorous.  And perhaps most importantly, it was shown that Lorentz covariance also held in Universe X and exactly why it did so.

"reciprocity_article" = "#[Reciprocity]#After failing to find a discrepancy between our universe and Universe X in the vertical flow of aexels, I was still in search of areas of differentiation between the two.  Also, after the previous success of being able to predict the dilation at the surface of a planet, I was also looking for other calculations I could perform in Universe X that could then be compared to calculations in our universe.  I then realized there was a related and very easy calculation I could perform in Universe X.

In our universe, a clock free falling from infinity to a planet would experience all sorts of gravitational field strengths and all sorts of velocities along the way.  It's unclear what the dilation would be for such a scenario.

But in Universe X, gravity not being a force, the clock would simply flow along with the aexels down to the planet never translating at all.  It was easy to see that it would experience no dilation what-so-ever at any point in the journey.

For our universe, however, the calculation differed:

<<RecEq1>>

At first I was unsure what to make of this result.  I considered 4 separate clocks (W, X, Y and Z) as detailed in the Four Clocks article.  While the static W and Y clocks matched in both universes, the moving X and Z clocks differed in both.  I set out to discover at what point the Einstein Field Equations and the Schwarzschild Metric went off the rails.

To some degree I'm not even sure how well I actually understood that reciprocity (which seemed transparently wrong to me) reigned in our universe.  In Einstein's 1905 paper on Special Relativity he states: \"It is clear that the same results hold good of bodies at rest in the 'stationary' system, viewed from a system in uniform motion.\"

That \"It is clear...\" is carrying a lot of weight here.  With no further justification he is simply declaring that two observers in relative motion to one another will both perceive the same thing.  Namely, they will both see the other's clocks dilated and the other's lengths contracted.  My guess is that he was motivated by trying to maintain the Reciprocity of Galilean relativity.

But for Universe X (and any universe with an absolute reference frame) Reciprocity is simply not true.  At this point I realized that the Reciprocity assumption is used to argue that ds² is invariant over inertial frame transformation and that ds² invariance is used to calculate the constant of motion in the Schwarzschild Metric that results in the discrepancies in the X and Z clock readings between the two universes.

And with that I realized that Universe X was not just describing the same thing using different words, but was fundamentally describing different physics.





";

"eeemcee_article" = "#[Energy-Mass Equivalence]#At this point, years into the study of Universe X, I still hadn't figured out the famous t-shirt equation, E=mc².  All the previous insights had developed organically just by following my nose, but in this case I decided to make a concerted effort to wrap my head around the equation and integrate it within the Universe X framework.

It turned out to not be terribly difficult, once I came to understand two separate cases: the conservation of energy and mass of a star as it sends out photons and the gravitational pull of a massless mirrored box with photons bouncing around inside.

In the case of the star, it is often described as mass being converted into energy, with the star losing mass while sending out the energy equivalent number of photons.  But, E=mc² also says that the ratio of mass and energy in a system is constant.  If you really ever had mass being converted into energy, then as m decreases and E increases the ratio of the two would stop being in balance.  The notion of 'conversion' simply could not be true.  Somehow the mass had to be leaving with the photons.

But it was the second case of the massless mirrored box with photons bouncing around inside that really distilled the essence of what was going on here.  With the understanding that this system without any massed particles would still have a gravitational pull, only one conclusion could be drawn.  Photons had to cause the 'mass effect'; photons also had to destroy aexels.

At this point there already was this concept of light speed particles and sub light speed particles that had some sort of internal motion.  It became clear that these sub light speed particles were really just very small massless mirrored boxes with something bouncing around inside.

And with this, the concept of hyle was born and edisons and teslons finally obtained their names echoing the Current War, with Thomas Edison's direct current and Nikola Tesla's alternating current.

It was this hyle that destroyed aexels, not mass.  This hyle always moved at the speed of light, sometimes directly in a straight line when within an edison and sometimes alternating back and forth when within a teslon resulting in a net speed of less than the speed of light.

At this point a serious problem occurred to me: \"If energy and mass are really just two effects of an underlying substance hyle, then how does potential energy fit into this idea?  Does potential energy destroy aexels?\"

I realized that the answer was, in fact, yes.  I imagined two protons aimed directly at one another.  Each has its intrinsic hyle and its kinetic hyle that allows the protons to translate across the aether.  However, as they approach one another, they slow down and eventually stop.

All of their intrinsic hyle remains, but they now have zero kinetic hyle.  In theory it is now potential energy, but then where is the hyle?  How is this potential energy still destroying the aexels?

I realized that as the protons near one another they begin to exchange photons.  Their kinetic hyle is drained into these photons being passed between the two protons.  Once the protons come to a complete stop, the entirety of their kinetic hyle is now contained in the photons in transit between the two protons.

And it's these photons in between the protons that continue to destroy the aexels.  Eventually these photons are reabsorbed by the protons as the they reverse course and head off back to where they came from.

"cupola_article" = "#[Electricity, Magnetism and the Cupola]###[Pings and Pongs]##Back in the day, while at university, long before Universe X, I was continually attempting to wrap my head around various phenomena in physics.  I got a salt shaker and shook some salt out onto my desk, gathered it into a pile and then pushed my finger into the pile creating a ring.  I then continually increased the radius of the ring by swirling my finger around inside.

It occurred to me that as I increased the radius of the ring the amount of salt at any point would fall off at 1/r and would fall off at 1/r² if I could perform a similar exercise in three dimensions.  I thought that there must be some mechanism akin to this salt model underpinning the 1/r² forces in Physics, but I had no idea how that would work or how to explain the seemingly endless supply of 'salt' needed.

When I released Aexel 3.0 in December of 2022 it included the new Dilation and Contraction simulations.  Implementing these simulations took my explanations for Dilation and Contraction from hand waving to a rigorous implementation; supporting my long held contention that the best way to make sure you understand something is to explain it to a computer.

But, for those two simulations I used a very simple and specific configuration of the particles.  Those configurations made calculating the trajectories of pings and pongs quite easy, but I had no idea how to do so in the general case, for particles moving in arbitrary directions and with various speeds.  I figured there must be a way to encode enough information in the ping in order to accomplish it, but I had no idea what that information was.

For Aexels 4.0 I wanted to add a much more complete electromagnetism simulation.  In order to accomplish this, I needed to figure out how to tell the target teslon which direction it needed to move in response to the ping it had encountered.  After playing with some geometry and trigonometry I realized there was a remarkably simple way to determine the direction of the force: just take the vector of the absolute trajectory of the ping of length c and subtract the vector of the absolute trajectory of the source teslon of length v.  (The term 'absolute' here, means the translation across the aexels themselves, i.e., relative to the v = 0 frame.)

This resultant vector would indicate the exact direction of the force.  Each ping could be embedded with this vector and any teslon encountering the particle would know which direction the force was to be applied.  I named this vector the 'cupola'.

But, this target teslon also needed to respond with a pong that was guaranteed to intersect with the source teslon.  I soon realized that if you reflected the absolute translation vector over the cupola vector and sent out a response edison also at the speed of light, the pong would precisely intersect that source teslon, assuming it had moved with constant velocity.

With these results in hand, I proceeded to build a simulation in the Aexels app.  Seeing this perfect and elegant ping / pong dance was really quite magical.

{{CupImg01}}

##[Magnetism and the Lorentz Force]##Also from my university days, I had some highly vague sense that the E and B fields and the Linear and Angular momentum vectors had to be some sort of orthogonal pointers, but this was a very foggy / undeveloped notion.

When I had first heard of magnetic and electric forces being frame dependent I reacted with great consternation and received no satisfactory explanation of what was really going on.  But, now armed with this new cupola vector the true nature of the E and B fields started to take form.

I realized that the B field was just the cross product of the cupola vector and the frame dependent translation vector; and with that realization, the frame dependence of the E and B fields finally made sense.

There is an equation in physics that really does not seem to fit in with all the other equations, the Lorentz force:

    F = qv × B

Not only is this force applied *perpendicular* to the B field, but is a function of v!  And while in Universe X the v of the Lorentz transformations represents the rate of the translation across the aexels, what does this v represent?  Two substantial mysteries in one small equation.

The first mystery is relatively easy to dismantle.  The B field being just the cross of the cupola and frame dependent translation vector means it is simply an artificial amalgam of two more fundamental vectors.  The force is actually not perpendicular at all; it's in the exact same plane defined by the cupola and frame dependent translation vectors.

As far as the velocity dependence of the force, if one plays with the numbers when dealing with the force one teslon exerts on another one can see that ultimately all E&M forces are simply coulomb forces in the frame of the source teslon.

The B component of the force only comes into play when trying to make sense of that E force in another frame.  It's a mathematical trick to make the force make sense in other frames and that amount of correction that is needed here is a function of the velocity of charge relative to the reference frame.

##[Hyle Exchange]##Unfortunately, modeling the hyle exchange was not nearly as straightforward.  The problem is that in natural units the momentum and energy carried by a photon is always equal.  But the momentum and energy lost by a teslon is never equal.  So how do you maintain local conservation through photon exchange?

Here I think we have butted up against the mysteries of Quantum Mechanics and this mystery will be left to be tackled in some future version of Aexels.

"squish_article" = "#[The Squish and the Accelerant]###[Gauss' Curse]##Since the very first insight, detailed in the 'Expansion' article, the Gauss problem has hung over this entire Universe X concept.  Namely, the problem that the aexel flux through each shell (the area of a sphere times the flow rate of the aexels) is not a constant and as such the aexels, as they flow inward, can't be conserved.

In addition to that, no progress had been made in understanding anything about aexel dynamics: Did they have momentum?  How did they exert a force on one another?  What is the mechanism for their destruction and creation?

New experimental data became available that I wasn't expecting.  Increasing evidence seemed to indicate that the gravitational force traveled at the speed of light.  The observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO sensor in 2017 showed that they too traveled at about the speed of light.  Certainly, there was nothing in Universe X that said gravitational waves couldn't travel at the speed of light, but also there was nothing that said they had to.

And one last thing I couldn't figure out: if aexels are being pulled towards concentrations of mass like a tablecloth through a hole, why aren't they less dense rather than more dense as you get closer to the mass?

Into this mix, I had two new tools available to me, LLMs and the ability to develop simulations using the GPU, which greatly increased the number of particles I could model.  It was time to explain this idea to my computer; it was time to figure out what was really going on here.

At this point in Universe X, gravity was understood through two basic concepts:
- that hyle destroyed the crystalline aexels and therefore pulled more aexels towards it like a tablecloth being pulled through a hole in a table,
- that gravity was not a force, but rather was a result of the acceleration of the aexels themselves and that the dilation at any point due to gravity was simply a measure of the rate of aexel flow at that point.

But Gauss and the other issues I just mentioned made reconciling these two concepts very difficult.  I decided the best way to move forward was to just try to explain both of these concepts to my computer and hopefully a method reconciling the two would occur to me during the process.

The simulation that modeled the destruction of aexels was named InsideOut.  The simulation that modeled the velocity and acceleration of the aexels from the outside was called OutsideIn.  The ultimate solution here came in two steps, the first step led me to realize that OutsideIn was correct (with modification), but the InsideOut was incorrect.  The second step led me to realize that InsideOut was also correct, but that a looser join to OutsideIn was required.

##[The Squish]##The InsideOut mechanism started with an aexel sink at the location of the mass.  Each second that mass would destroy a fixed number of aexels.  Those missing aexels would need to be replaced, so each shell surrounding the mass would need to have those missing aexels flowing through it each second.  At every point a distance r from the center there would be a specific velocity and acceleration of those aexels.

The OutsideIn mechanism started with the aexel flow.  It posited that the dilation at any point is an indication of the velocity of the aexels flowing through that point.  From that velocity the acceleration at every point could be calculated.

When you do those calculations the InsideOut mechanism gives a 1/r² relation for the velocity.  The OutsideIn mechanism gives a 1/r² relation for the acceleration.  How can these two be reconciled?

My thought since the very beginning of Universe X is that I would be able to resolve this through density variations, but when it came time to actually explain this to my computer I realized two things.  One, given the aexel model of distance, there actually is zero density wiggle room.  You can't increase density without increasing distance.  The Cartesian distance is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is the number of aexels you must jump to, to get from one point to the other.

The other issue is that, for example, for the Earth the aexel compression is quite mild.  The gravitational radius of the Earth is only 4 mm greater than the circumference radius.  Even if there was wiggle room in the density there is no way the severe correction that was required could be accommodated in this slight squeeze.

My mind boggled; is space actually 4D?  Are we living on the 3D surface of some 4D pond?  The thought of abandoning the entirely 3D sand box of Universe X was horrifying.

And then finally, the solution came to me.  I had long posited that gravity was not a force, but rather was an emergent phenomenon caused by the flow of aexels.  But, this was wrong and also sort of right.  Gravity *is* a force, but not a force on teslons and edisons; instead it is a force on the aexels themselves with the teslons and edisons coming along for the ride.

I had made the assumption that the destruction of aexels by hyle was local, but that assumption was also wrong.  The destruction happens as the aexels flow into smaller and smaller shells and consequently get squeezed out of existence.  It doesn't need to obey Gauss' law because the aexels don't necessarily get squished local to hyle.

We had seen how to solve the 1/r² force previously in E&M, so all we need to do is posit the existence of g-pings and voila, we have our gravitational force, but applied to the aexels themselves not the matter sitting on those aexels.

##[The Accelerant]##Once I sat down to start thinking about implementing the g-ping solution, problems became apparent at once.

As previously noted in the Kinematics article, the electromagnetic phenomenon is huge compared to the aexels.  The sophistication available to E&M compared to gravity might perhaps be akin to the sophistication available to an individual human compared to an individual bacteria.

It also operates on wildly smaller distances.  The idea that each bit of hyle was somehow sending out g-pings in all directions with such granularity that it would hit each and every aexel in each and every corner of the universe seemed ridiculously intractable.

My expanding salt analogy was useful in understanding E&M, but perhaps it was leading me astray here.  And in fact through the InsideOut mechanism I realized that there *was* another way to achieve a 1/r² relationship.  Namely, instead of *adding* particles to a system to achieve the relation, one could *subtract* particles instead.  In the first case the 1/r² relationship is represented by the density of the particles at any point.  In the second case the 1/r² relationship is represented by the current of particles at any point.

And with this thought the concept of the 'Accelerant' fluid was born.  Hyle destroys accelerant.  The velocity of the accelerant at any point is promoted to an acceleration of the aexels at that same point.

And as such, an absurdly intractable O(n²) g-ping problem is converted into a much more manageable O(n) fluid dynamics problem of the accelerant.

Now admittedly, this is a next level inference even in the world of Universe X.  However, even if it's totally off base, but succeeds in speeding up gravitational simulations, it can be a powerful tool.

On the other hand, if it does speed up gravitational simulations, why wouldn't 'god' make use of the same optimization in designing our universe?
