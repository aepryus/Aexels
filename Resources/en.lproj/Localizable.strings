"Forward" = "Forward to 3.0

Since the discovery of Universe X, there have been 7 light bulb moments, including that first.  This app was started after 4 of the light bulb moments.  A 5th light bulb moment occurred while that first version was being worked on.

Since that first version was released two additional light bulb moments have occurred, the first of which had sizable implications for many of the original articles.  But, I chose to leave them largely untouched and just tack on an additional article, in order to show the path of discovery.

However, with this version I am choosing to rewrite the articles based on the complete current understanding of Universe X.  I'm also going to integrate the information in the old 'Odds and Ends' article into their relevant articles (mainly Dilation).

There are also two new articles in version 3.0:
- Discrepancy - which discusses the 7th light bulb moment, the discovery of a substantial difference between Universe X and our Universe.
- Epilogue - where I will give short answers to a number of questions that are very difficult to answer for our Universe, but quite easy to answer for Universe X.

Unfortunately, there are no new explorers in version 3.0.  I am working on about 10 mid sized projects related to Oovium, Aexels, Evolizer and others that I'd like to get out as quickly as possible.  After, I complete those projects I will try to implement the Dilation and Contraction explorers.

Universe X

Come along as we explore this new universe and discover the similarities and differences it has with our own.

There are things we know for certain about Universe X; there are things we can speculate about and there are many things yet to be discovered.  Hopefully, over the life time of this app we will be able to continually increase our knowledge and understanding of this new world.

This app is divided into sections that each describe a different aspect of Universe X.  Eventually each of these sections will also contain an exploration screen that will allow the user to see each aspect modeled visually.

Currently there are explorers for Cellular Automata, Kinematics and Gravity.  The Cellular Automata explorer will allow the user to view a number of famous Cellular Automata and will also allow users to define and execute their own Cellular Automata using the Oovium visual programming language.  The Kinematics explorer compares simple motion in our Universe to that in Universe X.  The Gravity explorer attempts to qualitatively model the crystalline nature of Aexels themselves.

So what is Universe X?

Universe X is quite different from our own.  Our universe can, at times, seem quite magical: space curves, time dilates and both are intertwined with one another; it contains dark matter and dark energy; it is expanding and expanding at an increasing rate; God plays dice with our universe.

In contrast, Universe X is quite simple; it has no magic at all.  Universe X is entirely mechanistic.  It follows a few simple rules which are easy to understand and (hopefully) easy to model.

In the 19th century it was speculated that the space between planets and stars contained a fluid called the aether that was analogous to air.  This aether was the medium that allowed light waves to propagate, just as air is the medium that allows sound waves to propagate.  At the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery of Special Relativity it was realized that this aether does not exist in our universe.

In Universe X, however, not only does the aether exist, fundamentally, it is the only thing that exists.  But this aether, the aether of Universe X, has very little in common with the 19th century concept of aether.

The 19th century concept of aether was that of a fluid that the planets and stars moved through and displaced, just as an object moving in air or water displaces each of those fluids.  For example, as an airplane flies through the sky, air collides with it and flows along the surface of the craft.  It was believed that there must be a similar substance in space that both collides with and flows along the surface of the planets as they orbit the sun.

In 1887, Michelson and Morley performed their famous experiment looking for the flow of that aether along the surface of the Earth.  They were shocked to discover that no such flow existed.

In Universe X, the aether is not a substance that is displaced by planets and stars.  Rather, in Universe X, the aether is a substance upon which the matter of the universe sits.  It is the canvas upon which the painting appears; it is the game board upon which the chess pieces move.  The planets, the stars and ALL matter in Universe X sit atop of this aether and smoothly slide along it.

And like a computer monitor that is divided into a 2 dimensional grid of cells, called pixels (from 'picture elements' or 'picture cells'), each displaying a single color in order to render an entire image, the aether of Universe X is divided into a number of small 3 dimensional cells called aexels (from 'aether elements' or 'aether cells').

Currently, there are a few things we know about these aexels.  Like the atoms of a liquid, they can move and flow.  Like the atoms of a crystal lattice, they repulse when they get too close and attract when they get too far.  As such, the aether is compressible; the density of the aexels can vary, sometimes bunching up, other times spreading out.

These aexels have state.  Just as each pixel of a screen has a three dimensional state representing red, green and blue, each aexel also has a multidimensional state.  This state can change over time.  The changing of state in one aexel can, after a short delay, cause the change of state in neighboring aexels.

And perhaps most shockingly, based on those states, new aexels can be created and existing aexels can be destroyed.

At a base level, aexels are the only thing that exist in Universe X.  However, Universe X also has two other aspects: space and time.  Unlike our own universe where space and time are quite magical notions, where space can curve and time can dilate and each is intimately intertwined with one another, in Universe X, space and time are quite intuitive and boring.

Space in Universe X does not curve or expand; it is simply a three dimensional construct which houses the aexels.  Time in Universe X does not dilate; it is simply a one dimensional construct moving at a constant rate from past to present to future, mediating the progression of the state changes of the aexels as well as their motion.  In Universe X, space and time are entirely separate notions that are not intertwined at all.

Of course, these facts about the aexels of Universe X leave many questions unanswered.  For example, what is the exact equation of force between individual aexels?  Does the notion of momentum exist for aexels?  How many dimensions of state are there?  Answering these questions and many more will be the primary focus of this app for years to come.

As such, let our exploration begin…

"CellularAutomata" = "Cellular Automata

A cellular automaton is a system consisting of a grid (often times 2 dimensional) of cells each having state, which could be a simple on/off or could be any number of scalar and/or vector values.

The system progresses using a discrete concept of time called a time step.  Inherent in the system is a static set of rules that dictate how the state of each cell progresses for each time step.  This progression is a function of the current state of the cell and the state of the cell's neighbors.

For example, perhaps the most famous cellular automaton is Conway's Game of Life.  In Conway's game of life the world consists of a 2 dimensional square grid of cells.  Each cell can be either on or off.  The neighbors of a cell consist of the 8 cells directly surrounding it.  If exactly 2 neighbors are on, then the state of the cell will not change.  If exactly 3 neighbors are on then the state of the cell will be turned/remain on.  In all other cases the state of the cell will be turned/remain off.

This simple set of rules is able to exhibit an amazing amount of complexity.  Initially, when the cells of such a system are randomly populated the progression of state will be quite chaotic.  However, over time, patterns will automatically arise.

For example, if a closed subset of cells has a certain state at time t and that subset of cells returns to that same state at a later time, the cells will be in a stable state loop and continue that loop into perpetuity (or until it is disrupted somehow, i.e., stops being a closed subset).  Perhaps the cells remain in the same state each time step giving the loop a period of 1.  Or perhaps the cells loop back after 2, 3 or more steps, giving their loop a period of 2, 3 or more steps.

Such simple cellular automata have a number of similarities to Universe X.  For example Universe X is also made up of a set of discrete cells, in this case 3 dimensional.  These cells also have state and the state changes of these cells often loop back creating stable state loops.

In Universe X these loops can persist for long periods of time, have properties of their own and interact with other stable state loops.  These stable state loops are the basis of all \"matter\" in Universe X.

The matter of Universe X is not fundamental.  It is an artifact of the properties of aexels. It is not made up of particles; it is not made up of waves; it does not displace the aether.  Matter is made up of stable state loops that exist on top of the aether.

However, there are also some differences between Universe X and most cellular automata.  Unlike the static cells of Conway's game of life, the cells of Universe X are dynamic; they can move, they can be created and they can be destroyed.

The aexels of Universe X are created and destroyed as a direct result of the state changes of the aexels themselves.  The aexels move because they exert a force on one another, but ultimately this motion is first initiated by the creation and destruction of the aexels themselves.

Another somewhat speculative difference is that although the new states of our simple cellular automata are usually based on the current states of the cell and their neighbors, it is probably the case that the state change of an aexel is a function of the change of state rather than just the absolute state of the neighborhood.

In a cellular automaton, a computer will calculate each time step in its entirety before moving the system forward.  There is no such master computer in Universe X.  There is simply a time delay in transferring a state change from one aexel to its neighbors.  In Universe X this delay is called a 'tic'.

Each aexel in Universe X can only directly affect its neighbors and this effect takes one tic of time to occur.  Therefore the fastest a signal can move across a field of aexels in Universe X is one aexel per tic.

In Universe X, one aexel per tic is referred to as 'the speed of light'.





";

"Kinematics" = "Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion absent of force.  In our universe, such motion is quite straightforward.  Generally things in Universe X are less complicated than in our own universe, but in this case things in Universe X are considerably more complicated.

In the Cellular Automata section, a stable state loop was described as a closed set of cells with a certain state at time t, that returns to that same state at some later time.  However, this definition is perhaps unnecessarily restrictive.

If one observes Conway's Game of Life long enough they may notice a very interesting phenomenon.  Occasionally a pattern of cells arise that while persisting; does not do so in place; it \"moves\".  The most common such stable state loop in Game of Life is called a glider, which repeats its pattern every 4 time steps while translating diagonally by one cell during those 4 time steps.

Similarly, all of the stable state loops in Universe X have the ability to translate across a field of aexels.  However, due to the 'tic' time delay in transferring state from one aexel to its neighbor, this motion is strictly bound by the 'speed of light' (i.e., one aexel per tic).  This translation is one of the forms of motion possible in Universe X.

But there is another entirely different way in which a stable state loop can move.  Since the aexels themselves can move, it is possible for a stable state loop that is not translating across an aexel field at all, to simply move along with aexels it is sitting upon, like a leaf floating down a stream.  And since this motion is not dependent on the signal delay between neighboring aexels, its speed is in no way bounded.

And of course a stable state loop could be (and most of the time probably is) experiencing both of these forms of motion simultaneously.

There are some rather sticky ramifications to all of this.  In our universe a single particle moving in the absence of force can be described entirely by a velocity vector (ignoring quantum effects for the time being).  In Universe X, in order to accurately understand the motion of a stable state loop it is necessary to know the translating velocity of the loop measured in aexels per time as well as both the velocity of the aexels measured in distance per time and density of those same aexels, which in a simple system could be constant, but in more complex situations could vary from place to place.





";

"Gravity" = "Gravity

Gravity is the tendency of objects with mass to move towards one another.

Isaac Newton first described the Gravity of our universe as a force that all objects exert on one another across any arbitrarily large distance, proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  But, he acknowledged some discomfort with this idea:

\"That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.\"

When Albert Einstein described his theory of Relativity he shifted our understanding of Gravity.  He described gravity as being a result of the warping of spacetime caused by all objects with mass.

But, even with Newton and Einstein's contributions to Gravity we still really don't understand what Gravity is and why it exists.  In our own universe, Gravity remains a mystery.

But, in Universe X, Gravity is a quite simple and mundane phenomenon.

In Universe X there exists many different types of stable state loops.  There are potentially three ways these loops could interact with the aexels:

- they could destroy aexels:
It is quite certain that there are loops that destroy aexels in Universe X.  In Universe X these loops are referred to as 'matter'.  This article, 'Gravity', pertains to these types of loops.

- they could create aexels:
That there exists loops that create aexels in Universe X is somewhat speculative, but for a number of reasons not a tremendous leap.  In Universe X these loops are referred to as 'antimatter'.  The article 'Darkness' pertains to these type of loops.

- they could do neither:
Given the cellular automata analogy to Universe X, it's easy to imagine the existence of loops that don't affect the aexels; that neither create or destroy them.  However, perhaps it is necessary to consider the possibility that no such loops exist or at least they are less prevalent than one might initially assume.  The 'Equivalence' article discusses these possibilities further.

Generally, the loops that destroy aexels can be thought to have a destruction coefficient, which measures the rate at which the aexels are destroyed.  In Universe X, this destruction coefficient is called 'mass'.  As matter destroys the aexels, more aexels get pulled in because the aether's crystalline nature does not allow the individual aexels to ever get too far apart.

Imagine a round table with a table cloth upon it.  On the table cloth there are plates and glasses and silverware.  In the center of the table is a little hole.  A person crawls under the table and grabs the table cloth through the hole and then begins to pull the table cloth through the hole.  All of the items on the table will begin to slide towards the center of the table.  The dishware sitting on the table cloth will appear to be 'attracted' to the center.

In Universe X as various concentrations of matter continually destroy the aether between one another that matter itself will continually tend to clump together.  As that clump of matter gets bigger and bigger (or perhaps more precisely, more and more dense) the velocity at which the aether is pulled towards the clump will increase.

At some point, certain clumps in Universe X get so big (dense) and the velocity of the aexels flowing towards the clump becomes so great that a signal moving at one aexel per tic ('the speed of light') will not be able to escape the clump.  In Universe X, any clump that draws aether in at the speed of light is referred to as a black hole.





";

"Dilation" = "Dilation

Perhaps one of the most magical aspects of our universe is the phenomenon of time dilation.

In our universe time dilation is the variation in the perceived rate of time of various frames of reference based on their relative velocity to one another as well as the relative difference in their gravitational field strength.  That the rate of time itself can vary in our universe is severely magical in and of itself.

But, perhaps the most magical aspects of time dilation arise from the fact that in our universe there are no special frames of reference.  For example, two space ships traveling parallel to one another in opposite directions near the speed of light will both note that their clocks are running at a different rate than the other ship's clocks.  But, the really weird part is that both ships will see their own clock running faster and the opposing ship's clocks moving slower.

In Universe X, however, no such time dilation occurs.  There is however an analogous phenomenon, which is perhaps better described as 'animation dilation'.

Previously, the stable state loops of Universe X have been discussed as single entities.  However, the loops themselves have properties of their own and are able to interact with other loops in order to create increasingly large and complex composite systems.

In the Gravity article a classification of loops was created based on whether the loops created aexels (matter), destroyed aexels (antimatter) or did neither.  For the purposes of the Dilation and Contraction articles let's create a second classification: loops that translate at the speed of light (one aexel per tic) and loops that translate at less than the speed of light.

It would be nice to give names to these two classes, but there aren't great analogous names from our Universe that can be used.  One could almost use the term 'boson' for speed of light travelers and 'fermion' for sub-light travelers, but some bosons (such as W, Z and Higgs) move at less than the speed of light.  Still, perhaps, they can be a model for new names in Universe X.

It may be the case that all translation in Universe X is at one aexel per tic.  But, that some loops move directly in a straight line and therefore the loop itself translates at the speed of light and other loops have internal motion that alternates back and forth in some manner causing the net speed of translation to be less than the speed of light.

As such, let's refer to those loops that translate directly in a straight line (at the speed of light) as 'edisons' (ed-i-sans) and those loops that translate in some sort of alternating fashion (at less than the speed of light) as 'teslons' (tes-lans).

In Universe X teslons can interact with one another in order to create increasingly complex composite systems.  The interaction of these teslons will entirely be mediated by edisons.  Therefore the rate that the teslons will animate will entirely be a dependent on the the amount of time it takes the edisons to move back and forth between them.

Exactly how this happens in Universe X is still a subject of speculation, but in broad strokes, teslons continually generate edisons.  When one of these edisons hits another teslon, the edison affects that teslon's rate of translation across the aexel field.

For example, consider a teslon that is stationary on a field of stationary aexels (ignore gravity for a moment).  An edison traveling from elsewhere is moving towards the teslon.  When the edison hits the teslon (and is absorbed) the teslon begins to translate across the stationary field of aexels.

In this way, complex static or dynamic systems of teslons can be formed.  The rate at which a dynamic system will animate will be highly dependent on the amount of time it takes edisons to travel back and forth from teslon to teslon.

For two stationary teslons separated by a fixed number of aexels the edisons will travel between them at one aexel per tic.  However, if the teslons are both translating across the aexel field, the amount of time it takes edisons to move between them will vary based on the direction of motion of the edisons relative to the translating motion of the teslons across the aexel field.

In some cases the time will be less, in others the time will be more, but in all cases the round trip time of an edison between the teslons will increase as the rate of translation increases.  This increased round trip time will result in a slow down of the rate of the animation of the dynamic system of loops.

This dilation in Universe X is substantially different than the dilation of our universe.  For one thing, there IS a special frame of reference in Universe X.  A system will animate most quickly when it is not translating across the aexels at all, allowing the edisons to move most quickly between the teslons.

In Universe X dilation is not an observational phenomena.  It is a real physical phenomena that is entirely dependent on a system's rate of translation.  A system not translating at all will animate quickest; other systems will animate slower and slower as their rate of translation increases towards the speed of light, i.e. one aexel per tic.

In Universe X, two observers translating across the aexels in different frames will both agree on the relative animation rate of the two systems.  Both will see a fast system and a slow system and they will both agree on which is which.  There is no twin paradox in Universe X.

Let's try to calculate the animation dilation in Universe X as a function of the translational velocity of a system across an aexial field.  Two loops are arranged perpendicular to the aexial flow (north / south).  A signal traveling at c is sent out from one to the other and back.

<<DilaSketch>>

The question is how long does this roundtrip journey take?

First, let's look at the case where v = 0, the loops are not moving at all relative to the aexial field.  In this case the total distance traveled is 2d at a speed of c and total time, t = 2d/c.

In the second case, the loops are translating across the aexels at some non-zero 'velocity' (aexels/time), therefore the signal must travel a greater distance along the aexial field in order to complete its journey.  The journey north takes time, t_n.  The signal therefore travels c * t_n while the system moves v * t_n.  Using the Pythagorean theorem we then get:

<<Dilation>>

So, for a system of loops translating across an aexial field the signals traveling between loops will take longer and therefore the animation of that system will slow down entirely as a function of the rate of translation (aexels / time) across the aexels and that slowing down will be by the (perhaps familiar) equation above.





";

"Contraction" = "Contraction

Length Contraction is a phenomenon that causes all things to shrink in the direction of motion or in the direction of gravity.

In our universe, length contraction, similar to time dilation, has no special frames of reference, length contraction is an observational phenomena.  Two parallel spaceships passing each other at high speed will both see meter sticks on the other ship as being smaller then their own.

In Universe X, however, length contraction is a physical phenomenon and like dilation, is entirely a function of the rate of translation of a system across an aexel field.  A system that is not translating across an aexel field will experience no length contraction at all.  However, a system that is translating across an aexel field will experience a contraction in the direction of translation (or aexel flow from the perspective of the system itself) that is entirely a function of the rate of that translation.

In our universe there is a feature of nature called Lorentz covariance which indicates that the speed of light is constant across all frames of reference.

In Universe X this concept would appear to break down quickly.  For any system that is translating across an aexel field it would seem that the speed of light parallel to the direction of the aexel flow would be different than the speed of light perpendicular to the flow.

Certainly, in Universe X, the speed of light is always one aexel per tic.  But, since the aexels themselves can move and since they can vary in density it would seem it might be easy to detect variations in the distance traveled per time.

However, Lorentz covariance also holds in Universe X, just as it does in our universe.  And it does so because of length contraction.

In the Dilation article we calculated the increased amount of time needed to bounce a signal moving at the speed of light off a mirror and back when the signal is sent out orthogonal to the direction of translation (north / south).

For this article let's now repeat the same calculation but for a signal sent out parallel to the direction of translation (east / west).  Let's start by calculating when the velocity of translation is zero.

<<ContraSketch>>

In this case the signal travels 2d (the distance to the mirror) at a velocity of 'c' (the speed of light), so total time, t is 2d/c.  Now let's start translating the same system over the aexel field.

While the signal is moving to the right it is 'chasing' the mirror' therefore the total distance it needs to cover is 'd' the distance to the mirror plus v*t_e, v being the velocity of translation and t_e being the time needed to hit the mirror moving to the right.  Let's calculate that time, t_e:

<<ContraEast>>

Once the signal bounces off the mirror back to the source, the source will be moving towards the signal so the total distance that needs to be covered is d minus v*t_w, the translation velocity times the time needed to return to the source.  Let's calculate that time t_w:

<<ContraWest>>

The total time, t' is equal to the sum of t_e and t_w.  Let's compare it to the time when the system is not translating at all.

<<Contra>>

For the orthogonal case we saw that the time increased by a factor of gamma, but in this parallel case the time is increasing by a factor of gamma squared.  Which would mean that for a translating system two signals sent out at the same time, both bounced off a mirror 1 meter away one orthogonal to the direction of translation, one parallel, the two signals would return at different times.  Unless...

Length Contraction occurs and the length of things in the direction of translation are reduced by a factor of gamma.  In that case both signals would return at the exact same moment and the 'speed of light' would appear to be the same in both directions.

The amount of contraction precisely masks the change in the speed of light caused by the flow of aexels.  In Universe X, a meter stick's length itself is a function of the speed of light.  As the speed of light changes; the meter stick's length changes.

Measuring the speed of light with a meter stick is essentially a tautological exercise.  A meter stick uses the speed of light to measure the speed of light and not shockingly it always comes out to be: the speed of light.

One other important thing to note, is that this contraction only applies to the physical items in the system that is translating, not to the rest of the non-translating universe that happens to lie along the direction of translation.

If a ship is heading towards some distant star, the amount of meter sticks that will fit between the ship and the star will increase as the translation speed of the ship increases.  The distance to the star itself will not contract and therefore the distance to the star will appear to increase as the ship's speed increases.

"Darkness" = "Darkness

Astronomers observing our own universe have noticed some problems with our current understanding of Physics.  There are two major issues: One, is that for unknown reasons the universe itself appears to be expanding.  The other is that the galaxies of our universe appear to have greater gravitational pull than they should based on the amount of mass that they contain.

From these observations they realized that our universe contains dark energy which causes the universe to expand and dark matter which gives the galaxies more mass than they appear to have.  The mass of dark energy and dark matter account for about 96% of the mass of the universe.  Our observable universe only accounts for 4% of what exists.  96% percent of the mass of the our own universe has never been observed.

Luckily, once again, Universe X isn't nearly so magical.

Previously, we have mentioned 3 types of stable state loops:

- Loops that destroy aexels
- Loops that create aexels
- Loops that do neither

This article concerns the 'loops that create aexels'.  Let's call those loops 'antimatter'.

In our universe, there is a phenomenon known as pair creation.  Of the many known particles of our own universe each has an antiparticle that is equal and opposite in every way.  If a matter loop destroys aexels then perhaps it's the case that an antimatter loop creates them.

And while the matter of Universe X clumps up into galaxies and stars and planets continually drawing in aexels as a drain in a tub continually draws in water.  The antimatter of Universe X spreads out as a dust permeating the space between those galaxies continually creating new aether between the galaxies causing the space between them to continually increase.

It has been observed that at times a particle and its antiparticle can be created.  Similarly, if a particle and its antiparticle meet they can each be destroyed.  As such perhaps it's the case that the total matter in Universe X is always equal to the total antimatter.  And if a matter loop destroys aexels at the same rate that an antimatter loop creates them then perhaps the total number of aexels is always in balance.

This net teleportation of aexels from inside of galaxies to outside of galaxies could then account for a red shift of photons traveling through the antimatter dust; making a steady state universe appear to be expanding.

Alternatively, Universe X may have been initially seeded with more antimatter loops or perhaps the rate that antimatter loops create aexels is greater than the rate the matter loops destroy them and Universe X really is expanding.

If this explains the 'Dark Energy' of Universe X, what about the 'Dark Matter'?

The aexels of Universe X form a crystal like lattice.  They sit in a potential well not wanting to get too far away from one another, but also not wanting to get too close.  It can be difficult to tell the difference between a pull and a push.

The destruction of aexels in Universe X looks like a pull.  The creation of aexels in Universe X will look like a push.  If the galaxies of Universe X are filled with matter loops pulling from the inside, perhaps they are also surrounded by antimatter loops pushing from the outside; the same antimatter loops that are causing the aether between galaxies to expand.

As such the antimatter dust of Universe X both causing the 'expansion' of the aether between galaxies and push on the galaxies from the outside which can be difficult to differentiate from a pull coming from the inside.

"Equivalence" = "Equivalence

E=mc²

Often times the mass-energy equivalence principle is incorrectly described to be a conversion formula; representing the ability to convert energy into mass or mass into energy at the stipulated rate.  However, the mass-energy equivalence principle says something dramatically more bold: It says that the total mass of a system and the total energy of a system are always related to one another by the c² factor.

But, how could this possibly be true?  What is mass really?  What is energy really?  This equation strongly implies that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin.

In our universe both mass and energy are conserved quantities.  Our own sun loses about 4 x 10^9 kg of mass every second through the fusion process which radiates about 3.6 x 10^26 joules of photons.  If mass is a conserved quantity and if photons are massless, where did that mass go?  Theoretically, a box with massless mirrored interior walls with light bouncing around inside will have a mass equal to the energy of the photons inside divided by c².  Could it be that massless photons do in fact have mass in some manner of thinking?

When initially thinking about Gravity in Universe X, it was hypothesized that 'mass' destroys aexels; it was also hypothesized that energy was the translation of that mass across an aexel field.  Thinking back to the classification of Universe X's loops between those that move at the speed of light, edisons and those that move less than the speed of light, teslons; it was easy to imagine teslons being the destroyers and creators of aexels because they have mass while perhaps the edisons, such as photons, doing neither because they don't have mass.

But, thinking about a star radiating photons and losing mass, perhaps it's not 'mass' that destroys aexels, but rather translation that destroys aexels.  Perhaps the 'mass' of teslons is simply the internal translations of the components of the loop.  And photons while translating also destroy aexels, but always in its wake, never internal to itself, explaining why the 'mass' of photons is so ambiguous.

- loops that do neither

If all teslons have 'mass' and therefore destroy aexels and if edisons, such as photons, also destroy aexels as they translate across the aexel field then the question is do all edisons destroy aexels while they translate or just some?  Are there no loops that neither destroy or create aexels?

Let's consider the mechanism of Coulomb's law in Universe X.  From the Dilation article we know that the one way time of transit between two teslons doesn't matter, but rather only the round trip time.  There must be some sort of bounce that occurs.

In our Universe photons are described as the force carriers of the Coulomb's force.  Let's consider that possibility in Universe X.  Let's take an empty universe with a lone non translating proton sitting on a static aexel field.  Perhaps the proton radiates photons, which then look for other charge carriers to interact with.

However, there are two issues with this model, one, protons have energy and would be radiating that energy away from the proton similar to our star from before.  And two, a photon being sent out hypothetically would interact with any other charged loop that it encounters, not necessitating any bounce.

Let's try again; this time let's have our proton radiate non aexel destroying edisons.  Right away this solves the conservation of energy and mass issues, since the edisons being sent out aren't destroying aexels as they translate; they have no mass, they have no energy.

Perhaps this non aexel destroying edison now encounters another charged loop causing that second charged loop to pass an aexel destroying photon back towards the original.  Once that photon hits the originating loop it interacts with it affecting its translational velocity.  In this way the time delay between sending out a non aexel destroying edison and receiving the aexel destroying photon back IS a function of the round trip time.

This second model conserves mass/energy and explains the importance of the roundtrip duration.  It also strongly hints at the existence of non aexel destroying / creating edisons.

- potential energy

Consider two protons in Universe X on a static aexel field directly translating towards one another.  We know there is a single quantity that can be called mass or energy (m:e) that is always conserved.

Each of the protons has a fixed amount of m:e coming from some sort of internal translation of edisons inside of themselves.  They also have an amount of m:e 'stored' in the kinetic energy of the moving protons.

As the protons approach one another their speeds begin to slow until finally for an instant, both protons come to a complete stop.  At that point they still have their internal m:e, but the protons' kinetic m:e is now zero.  Has the quantity been conserved; where has it gone?

The quantity has been conserved because it is now stored in the photons that are being passed back and forth between the two protons.  The amount of m:e in those photons is exactly equal to the kinetic energy of the photons when they were infinitely far apart.

In Universe X potential energy is actually just kinetic energy.

Since the beginning of Universe X it was uncertain whether there were any experimentally verifiable differences between our Universe and Universe X.  It's possible that Universe X was just a different way of achieving the same results as our Universe.  However, finally a verifiable difference has been uncovered.

Dilation at the Surface of a Sphere

Now that we know what the dilation will be as a function of the translation rate across the aexels; let's now calculate what the dilation would be at the surface of a non-rotating sphere.

As discussed in the Gravity section, gravity in Universe X is not a force, but rather is a result of the destruction and creation of aexels and the pulling and pushing that that causes on the aethereal fabric.  Gravity alone, therefore, cannot directly initiate the translation of a loop across an aexial field.  All it can do is pull on the aexial field itself.

Let's take an empty universe and place a planet P and a tennis ball B in it, infinitely far apart, both of which are not translating across the aexial field at all.  If we assume Newton's law of gravitation to be empirically true of Universe X, we can calculate the velocity of the tennis ball once it hits the surface of the planet.  Since gravity can not directly cause a translation across the aexels, the velocity of the tennis ball must equal the velocity of the aexels upon which it is sitting.

<<DiscrA>>

This gives us the velocity of the aexels flowing into the planet at its surface.  Any system at rest on the planet's surface will have the aexels flowing through it at that velocity, therefore we can plug that velocity into the previous dilation equation in order to get the dilation at the surface.

<<DiscrB>>

Coincidently, the dilation at the surface of a non-rotating sphere in Universe X is the same as that for our Universe.


Dilation while Falling from Infinity

In the previous calculation we dropped a tennis ball from infinity in order to calculate the velocity of the aexels flowing into the planet at the surface so that we could calculate the dilation for a system at rest on that surface.  What about the dilation for the tennis ball itself?

In our Universe, this calculation might be pretty challenging, since time dilation is both a function of velocity and gravity and since both the velocity and gravity is constantly changing throughout the tennis ball's journey.

However, in Universe X, this calculation is quite easy.  Dilation in Universe X is solely a function of the translating velocity over the aexial field.  In Universe X, throughout the journey from infinity down to the planet's surface, the tennis ball's translation velocity remains zero; it is simply flowing down along with the aexels.  And since, throughout the journey, there is never any translating velocity, there is therefore never any dilation.

Universe X Answers

\[1a\] What is the speed of light?

Universe X is filled with a quantized crystalline fluid called 'aether'.  Each element of the aether is called an 'aexel'.  Each aexel can communicate with its neighbors.  It takes exactly one 'tic' of time for a signal to move from an aexel to its neighbor.  The 'speed of light' is the translation of a signal at one aexel per tic.

\[1b\] Why is it not possible to go faster than the speed of light?

It's not possible to go faster than the speed of light because signal can't move between two aexels faster than a tic and its not possible for an aexel to directly signal aexels that aren't its own neighbors; it can't skip over aexels.

\[1c\] Why does light travel at light speed?

Light travels at light speed because it translates in a straight line, moving a full aexel each tic.

\[1d\] Why can't things with mass move at light speed?

Things with mass have internal structure and translation internal to itself.  While a massful loop translates as a whole, its internal components are also translating.  In order for the loop as a whole to translate at the speed of light it would be necessary for at least some of its internal components to travel at more than the speed of light.  Since the internal components can't travel at greater than light speed, the loop as a whole must travel at less than light speed.

\[2a\] Does God play dice with the Universe?

No.  The seemingly random behavior observed in certain experiments is caused by the (un)known hidden geometry of the aexels at any given point.  The precise location of the aexels at any instance can have an impact in the translation of loops crossing over them.  The observed behavior is statistical not probabilistic.

\[2b\] Is matter a particle?  Is matter a wave?

Matter is neither a particle or a wave.  It is a stable state loop iterating across a field of aexels.

\[3a\] Is space 4D? 11D?

Space is 3D.  The aether is a crystalline compressible fluid.  The aexels can flow; they can bunch up; they can spread out.  Arguably, the density of the aexels at any point could be considered a 4th dimension.  But, calling space or the aether itself 4 dimensional because it's compressible really doesn't make any more sense than calling any compressible gas 4D or for that matter any gas that varies in temperature, humidity or any other imaginable property from point to point as 4D.

\[3b\] What does it mean for space to warp?

Space does not warp.  However, the Aether does squish; the aether does stretch.

\[4a\] What is a black hole?

A black hole is any concentration of matter dense enough to have a shell surrounding it with an escape velocity equal to the speed of light.

\[4b\] What happens inside of a black hole?

Nothing particularly interesting.  A black hole must be filled with matter all the way to its horizon, because the escape velocity will always be greatest at the surface.  Both above and below the surface the escape velocity will continually drop.  That shell where the escape velocity is equal to c simply can not have any mass because mass can't travel at c (see above).

If a star existed with an escape velocity just below being a black a hole and a tennis ball got tossed into it causing it to cross the line of being a black hole, would anything particularly dramatic happen to the interior of that star?

\[4c\] Why can't light escape?

Light can't escape a black hole because the aexels are flowing into it at the speed of light.  Light can't go faster than light speed and therefore will never be able to cross the boundary of that shell, like a runner running on a treadmill that is turned up past their max speed.

\[4d\] What is gravity?  What is its mechanism?

Universe X is made up of a quantized crystalline fabric called the aether made up of aexels.  Crystalline in that the aexels are bound to their neighbors and sit in a potential well from their neighbors, never letting themselves and their neighbors get too close or too far apart.

Some state loops in Universe X cause the destruction of these aexels.  This causes the aether to get pulled in.  As the aether gets closer and closer to the matter it accelerates at an increasing rate.

\[4e\] How can a star attract a photon?

It has been stated that Gravity is a force that is proportional to the product of the masses of two objects.  If a photon has no mass doesn't it follow that it will be unaffected by Gravity?

A Photon (and any loop in Universe X whether it destroys or creates aexels or not) will be affected by gravity because gravity is in fact not a force.  It is an emergent phenomenon better described as an acceleration caused by the pulling in of the aether and everything sitting on top of that aether.

And as Galileo point out long ago that affect is in no way a function of the mass of objects being 'pulled' on.

\[4f\] What is a gravity wave?  What is waving?

A gravity wave is a compression wave of the density of aexels.  Just as a sound wave is a compression wave of air.

\[5a\] What is time dilation?

In Universe X, 'time' does not dilate.  The rate at which physical system animate dilates and it does so because of the delayed round trip time of light speed traveling loops between objects when translating across the aexel field.

\[5b\] Is there really no special frame of reference?

There IS a special frame of reference; the frame of reference that is not translating across the aexel field at all will animate the fastest and experience no length contraction.  Any other frame will animate slower and experience length contraction entirely as a function of its rate of translation.

\[5c\] Do two observers both consider their own clocks to be faster?

No.  There will be an observer with a fast clock, an observer with a slow clock and each will know which is which.  And it will entirely be a function of each observer's current rate of translation across the aexel field.

\[5d\] How does one resolve the twin paradox?

One twin will be translating slower than the other twin on the aexel field.  The twin that is translating slower will age more rapidly.

\[5e\] What is the relationship between Special and General relativity?

Special and general relativity are the exact same phenomena; the translation of systems across an aexel field.  In the case of special relativity a moving system is translating across a static aexel field and in general relativity a static system is translating across a moving aexel field.  But, in both cases the affect simply concerns the translation of a system over an aexel field.

\[6a\] What is Length Contraction?

Length Contraction is an actual physical phenomena causing loops to sit closer to one another along the direction of translation entirely a function of the rate of translation.

\[6b\] Why is the speed of light always invariant?

It is always invariant because length contraction masks changes in the speed of light.  The length of things in the direction of translation is a function of that speed of translation and that change of length will cancel out the change of the speed of light causing the speed of light to always appear to be invariant.

\[6c\] Do two observers both consider their own meter sticks to be longer?

No.  Just like in Dilation above, both observers will see a long stick and a short stick and will no which is which.  And it will be based entirely on each observers current rate of translation across the aexel field.

\[6d\] If length contracts along the direction of travel; when traveling fast will the universe flatten into a pancake?

No.  Length contraction only affects systems that are actually translating.  The length between any other non translating systems in Universe X will be unaffected.

\[7a\] What is the expansion of the universe?

The expansion of the universe is the creation of aexels.

\[7b\] What causes it?

Every loop has an anti loop that is equal and opposite in every way.  Matter loops destroy aexels and as such antimatter loops create them.

\[7c\] What is Dark Energy?

Dark energy is the antimatter loops creating aexels there by causing the \"expansion of the universe\"

\[7d\] What is Dark Matter?

Dark Matter does not exist.  The phenomena that hints at dark matter is caused by the same entity that causes the phenomena hinted at by dark energy, namely the antimatter particles that are creating aexels.  Those new aexels pushing on galaxies from the outside.  That push from the outside appearing to be a pulling from the inside, but is not.

\[7e\] Why does there appear to be more matter than antimatter in the Universe?

Matter destroys aexels constantly bringing things towards itself.  Antimatter creates aexels constantly pushing things away from itself.  While matter continually clumps up into increasing large structures.  Antimatter continually spreads out as a dust between the matter clumps.

\[8a\] What does E=mc^2 really mean?

E=mc^2 means that mass and energy are two affects of the exact same phenomenon.

\[8b\] What is its mechanism?

The translation of certain loops (but not all) cause the destruction (or creation) of aexels.  Some of this translation occurs internal to a loop such as in a proton, neutron or electron.  The mass of those objects being a measure of the amount of translation occurring internally.  Other translation occurs in the movement of the loops as a whole.

The internal translation being the original display of mass and the external translation being the original display of energy.  E=mc^2 points out that both are the exact same phenomenon.

\[8c\] Does a photon have mass?  Where does the mass a star radiates go?

Unlike a proton, a photon does not have internal translation.  Its translation is in a straight-line.  The destruction or creation of aexels by a photon always occurs in its wake never internal to itself.

So, if mass is the destruction of aexels then yes it does have mass.  Alternatively if one were to define mass as only the destruction of aexels caused by internal motion then no it does not.

The mass of a star radiated out leaves with the photons being spewed by that star.

"GameOfLife" = "This is a cellular automata lab.  Here users can run predefined automata as well as define their own.

Above is the cellular automata definition panel.  The automata are defined using the Oovium visual programming language.  Here, Conway's Game of Life is being defined.  Tapping the aether picker in the upper left hand corner enables one to switch between various cellular automata and also to define their own by hitting the 'new' button.

The play / pause button will put the automaton into motion (or pause it).  The reset button will stop the automaton and reinitialize the cells.  The guide lines button will turn on and off the zoom indicator boxes.

There is a time dilator slider, which allows the steps per second to be adjusted, speeding or slowing the system between 1 step per second up to 60 steps per second.

The automata itself is displayed via 3 world views.  The top large view is the main world view panel.  Tapping this panel will cause a 2x zoomed section of the world to appear in the second panel.  Tapping the second panel will cause a 4x zoomed section to appear in the third panel.

Game of Life

In 1970, British Mathematician, John Conway devised the cellular automaton known as the Game of Life.  Conway was attempting to create a much simpler version of a system previously devised by John von Neumann in the 1940s.

The rules to Conway's Game of Life are fairly straightforward: Take a plane made up of square cells.  Each cell can either be on or off.  Each cell has 8 neighbors, the 8 cells directly surrounding it.  If two of a cell's neighbors are 'on' then the cell's state is unchanged.  If three of the cell's neighbors are 'on' then the cell's state is turned / remains on.  In all other cases the cell's state is turned / remains off.

Some things to look for:

- Look for static patterns (called still lifes).  These are any shapes that repeat each step, i.e., stay exactly the same each step.  One common still life is the 'block', which is 4 pixels situated in a square.

- Look for any dynamic patterns.  The most common dynamic pattern is a bar 3 cells long.  It will continually iterate between horizontal and vertical.  This loop is called a 'blinker'.  The blinker is by far the most common dynamic pattern.  There are a handful of other relatively common 2 step loops, such as 'beacons' and 'frogs'.

- About once every few runs a rather large 3 step loop called a 'pulsar' will develop.  In some cases a half pulsar will develop on the edge of the world.

- Perhaps the most famous loop is called the 'glider'.  The glider is a fairly common 4 step pattern, that has one important distinction from the above loops.  The glider is a translating pattern, which is to say it moves across the plane.

For the purpose of Universe X there are a number of important qualitative concepts illustrated by Conway's Game of Life that can be gleaned fairly quickly.  However, a shockingly large amount of research has been done into Conway's Game of Life and a few minutes with Google can open up this massive body of work to enable further research, if so desired.

Another type of cellular automaton, is the cyclic cellular automaton devised by David Griffeath of the University of Wisconsin.  And while perhaps not quite as fruitful as Game of Life in generating complex systems, it does nicely illustrate a number of important qualitative concepts, in addition to making pretty cool pictures.

A cyclic cellular automaton again makes use of a plane tiled with square cells.  Each cell can be in one of n possible states (in this case 12) and has 4 neighbors; the cells directly above, below, left and right of it.

If any of the neighboring cells is in a state that is one more than the current cell (or 0 for a cell of state n-1), then the cell will be eaten and take on the state of the neighboring cell.  A cell can eat and be eaten in the same time step.  This allows loops to form that contain each of the n states.  These loops will create spirals called demons.

Using the Oovium visual programming language it is possible to define custom cellular automata.

Double tapping on an empty area of the Oovium panel will create a new bubble.  By default an instance bubble will be created that allows the user to enter in a number or a calculation.  Using the bubble maker in the upper right of the Oovium panel, one can also create an IfBub which is a visual conditional or a MechBub which enables the creation of custom functions.

The workspace of Oovium is called an 'aether' (Oovium was created well before Universe X was discovered and the usage of the term aether is just a coincidence).  By default, each of the aethers in the automata lab are pre populated with an AutoBub, which allows one to define their own cellular automata.

The top area of the AutoBub represents a cell and its neighbors' current state: the neighborhood.  The bottom area represents the cell's new state which should be a calculation based on the current state of the neighborhood.

There is also a properties button which will allow for the number of states to be defined (between 2 and 32) and also allow for various colors to be selected for the different states.

"KinematicsLab" = "Kinematics Lab

Motion in our own universe can be described entirely by a vector which represents the velocity of a given object.  In Universe X, however there are two distinct forms of motion: translation across the aether and the flow of the aether itself.  In order to fully describe motion in Universe X, one must know both the translating vector and the aethereal flow vector, as well as the density and geometry of the aexels themselves.

This lab allows us to compare the motion of our Universe with that of Universe X.  The lab models an object frictionlessly moving inside a 2 dimensional box, elastically bouncing off the walls.

For Universe X, the model uses a regular hexagonal tiling to represent the aether.  The translational \"velocity\" vector represents the percent chance that the object will move to an adjacent cell each time step from 0 to 100 percent.  If the vector falls between two faces the chance of moving to either face is weighted based on the direction of the vector.  In this way motion in any arbitrary direction, not just the 6 cardinal directions can be achieved.  This random walk model is known as a Feynman checkerboard.

Perhaps the first thing one might note when comparing the two models is that motion in the Universe X model is quite jerky as opposed to the smooth motion of the model for our Universe.  However, the Universe X model is a statistical model and we are looking at both large aexels and large time steps.  As the density of aexels and time steps increase the motion will continually get more and more smooth until it would become difficult to differentiate the motion of the two systems.

In looking at the Universe X model there are two important things to note.  The first is that during collisions there can be a transfer between translating motion and flow motion.  For example, if we stop the translating motion entirely and point the aether directly downward (see Experiment B).  The particle will smoothly flow down along with the aether.  However, once the particle hits the bottom wall, the flow motion will be converted into twice the translating motion upwards, which when added to the flow motion will cause the object to move upwards at (statistically) the same velocity with which it moved downwards.

The other thing to note then is that as the density of aexels and time steps increases, the flow of the aether is irrelevant to the dynamics of the system.  I.e., a system where there is no aethereal flow will behave statistically the same as one in which there is an aethereal flow.

Although it is the case that God plays dice with our Universe, it is an open question as to whether God plays dice with Universe X.  In this situation, it was necessary for the model to employ a random number generator in order to model the motion.  Arbitrary directions of translation could not be achieved without this randomness.  However, this does not imply that such randomness is a necessary component of Universe X.

In this case the aether is modeled simplistically with regular 2 dimensional hexagons.  However, one could imagine the actual distribution of 3 dimensional aexels in Universe X as being quite irregular.  Potentially an entirely deterministic way of jumping from aexel to aexel would appear random due to the unknown hidden variables which are the geometry of the aexels themselves.



";

"GravityLab" = "Gravity Lab

Note: In addition to the new experiments a number of interactive abilities have been added:
    - Aexels can now be dragged around.
    - An Aexel can be locked in place by tapping on it.
    - A new Aexel can be created by tapping on empty space.
    - An Aexel can be destroyed by double tapping on it.


This is the long overdue first attempt to model the Aexels themselves.  Certainly, the ideal will be to create a quantitative model, however there are way too many open questions to attempt that currently.  As such the goal at this point is to create a qualitative model of Universe X and its aexels.  The hope being to create a visceral picture of Universe X; a thousand words per frame at 60 frames per second.

This first modest model attempts to recreate the dynamics of the aexeal fabric itself, the aether.  In this case the aexels can create bonds between each other.  The bonds have a relaxation distance; if they are too close they will push apart, too far they will pull together.  However, aexels that are double the relaxation distance from one another can not create bonds and if a bond already exists between them it will snap.

This model is entirely two dimensional and bonds can not cross one another.  When two bonds cross, the shorter bond will take precedence and snap the longer bond.  The aexels themselves have no concept of momentum; each bond creates a push or pull in the direction of the bond proportional to the distance from relaxation.  The aexel then jumps slightly in the direction of the sum of the pushes and pulls.

In this lab there are four preset experiments; the first three differ only in the number of aexels and the relaxation distance.  The last experiment implements Conway’s Game of Life on top of the dynamic lattice, giving a flavor of the possible interplay between the aexels and the loops sitting upon them.

Currently, this model does a respectable job of healing holes in the aethereal fabric.  The next step is to attempt to model gravity itself.  This will require a mechanism for creating and destroying aexels based on the loops on top.  In order to succeed the fabric probably needs to be even better at healing itself and realistically there will need to be a lot more aexels.  The key to adding more aexels will be continually increasing the performance of the algorithms being used here.

"DilationLab" = "Dilation Lab

Cheat Sheet:
    - Play / Pause: to pause and unpause the simulation
    - Reset: to clear the simulation and restart with current settings
    - Speed of Light: define the speed of light in points (pixels) per second.
    - Velocity: the translation velocity of the teslons (blue) across the aexels as a percent of c.
    - Auto: turns on an auto-pulse which sends out green edisons from the source every 2 seconds.
    - Tails: turns on tails for the edisons which illustrate their direction of translation across the aexel field.
    - Fixed: Turns on/off the fixed camera that moves with the aexels instead of the teslons.  (although jumps ahead when the teslon leaves the screen.)
    - Pulse: Manually sends out a pulse of green edisons from the source blue teslon.

In our Universe 'Time Dilation' is a very magical phenomena.  'Time' itself is dilating.  There are no special frames of reference and the observations of different systems is a function of the observers themselves rather than being based on fundemental physical processes.  The Twin paradox is an actual paradox in our Universe.

In Universe X however, 'Dilation' is not magical at all.  First of all, 'Time' does not dilate, but rather the rate at which physical systems animate.  In Universe X this rate of animation has nothing to do with the relative speed difference between different frames of reference, but is entirely based solely on the rate of translation of various systems across the aexel field.

In Universe X 'Dilation' is in no way dependent on an observer; each system experiences a specific `Dilation` entirely and solely a function of it's rate of translation across the aexel field.

This dilation in Universe X has a physical basis; it is caused by the slow down of 'edison' (loops that move at the speed of light) messengers traveling between the 'teslons' (loops that move at less than the speed of light).

This laboratory gives a viceral description of the process of dilation in Universe X.  As the rate of translation of a system of teslons (the blue circles) increases the amount of time it takes a signal to move back and forth increases.

This simulation knows nothing about the equations of relativity.  It simply shows teslons moving at a velocity v as a percent of c (as specified by the user) and edisons moving at velocity c.  From these simple rules 'dilation' naturally appears.

In playing with the simulation try to observe the increased distance that must be traveled between the teslons as the rate of translation increases.  Be particularly cognizant of the direction of translation of edisons as the move back and forth.

Note:
In this simulation the individual aexels are not being modeled, only the flow of the aexel field in general.  Electromagnetic phenemena as being illustrated here works at a much larger scale than the aexels and as such the continuous approximation is a fair representation of reality.  For example, if each aexel were one meter across, than the radius of a proton would extend beyond the orbit of Venus.

Twin Paradox
Let's imagine I have a set of twins and two spaceships, P and Q.  The spaceships are docked to one another and each twin gets into one.  Now imagine the following 3 situations:

    - [1] P stays right there, Q accelerates to 0.9 c travels for a year and then turns around coming back.
    - [2] P accelerates to 0.9 c in the opposite direction, travels for a year and then turns around coming back.
    - [3] Both P and Q accelerate in opposite directions at 0.45 c, travel for a year and then turn around coming back.

For each of the 3 scenarios which twin is older?  Are the results the same for all the scenarios?  If not how do the scenarios differ at all?

In our universe all motion is relative.  There are no special frames of reference.  Thus answering this question can be very tricky and thusly the Twin Paradox is a paradox.

In Universe X however, answering the above is relatively straight forward, however it is not possible without one additional piece of data: How fast where the twins translating across the aexel field initially?

For example, if when they were docked they weren't traveling across the aexel field at all.  Then the answers would be [1] P is older; [2] Q is older; [3] P and Q are still the same age.

However, if the twins had been translating across the aexels inititally than the answers could be entirely different.  Without knowing the initial rate of translation it is impossible to answer the question, but once you do know the initial rate of translation and the direction the spaceships travel relative to the direction of that translation it becomes straightforward to calculte the relative ages of the twins.

In Universe X, there is no Twin Paradox.

BUBBLES:
- IfBub : A visual conditional that can be used instead of the in-bubble 'if' function.  Aside from its visual representation, it also has the advantage of only evalutating the appropriate resultant.  This makes the IfBub very useful in creating recursive functions without needing to use the Function data type.

- TailBub : A new type of a MechBub specifically designed for creating recursive functions, greatly simplifing the ability to create loops.  The TailBub's visual structure guides the user in creating a tail call optimized recursion which has performance advantages over MechBub recursion, but more importantly eliminates the 500 loop limit of the MechBub.  (The TailBub will process for up to 1 second, which allow for signficantly more iterations)

- CronBub : Allows for the creation of a timer that increments its value periodically based on input parameters.  The utility of the CronBub, is perhaps a bit limited at this point, but it will become an essential tool for modeling and animating with the arrival of the 2nd aspect of Oovium.

- TypeBub : Allows for the mapping of entities and relationships.  Currently, the TypeBub is not integrated with the other bubble types of Oovium and is a faint shadow of it's ultimate functionality.  However, it has been slipped into this version both as a preview of future attractions and because even in it's current form, it can be useful in creating some simple diagrams.

FUNCTIONS:
- [!,&,|] - the 'not' !, 'and' & and 'or' | operators have been added to the Lexicon

OTHER:
- The resolution of exported images has been increased to match the retina display.  There are still plans to create a vector output, but that hasn't been done yet.

- In conjunction with the conversion of Oovium to OS X, once again massive under-the-cover refactoring has occurred with this version, including the conversion to the ARC memory model, a revamp of the Hover mechanism, some tweaks to the Math engine and major restructing of the Bubble system to allow for easier creation of new Bubbles, although more work is still needed with that.";

"ooviumText" = "Welcome to Oovium

What if a person ignorant of all past calculation tools were to design from scratch an app for doing calculations that made full use of the technology and concepts available to us today?  What would that application look like?

Over the years Aepryus has had numerous ideas for applications.  Eventually, it was realized that six of these ideas were just six different aspects of the same program.  Oovium is that program.

Or rather, Oovium will become that program.  Oovium is a mathematical sandbox.  As of version 1.1, Oovium includes one of the six aspects; code named Bricklin; this aspect is the implementation of an object oriented spreadsheet.  Eventually, the other 5 aspects will be incorporated into Oovium, code named Crawford, Shazaam, Archimedes, Eddington and Mithrandir.";

"ooviumMmText" = "Oovium Mind Mapper

Designed to replace your white board; it allows you to place nodes on a field (the aether) and designate links between them. Each node can have multiple inputs and outputs (a directed graph).

Particular attention was given to creating a natural and elegant gesture suite that allows for quick and easy manipulations of the bubbles upon the aether.

Be sure to read up on Anchoring to learn about these gestures.";

"anchoringText" = "The Joy of Anchoring

The workspace of Oovium is an arbitrarily large 2 dimensional plane that allows users to place bubbles upon it.  This plane is referred to as the Aether.  As Bubbles are added to the Aether, it automatically resizes to accommodate all of the bubbles.  In using Oovium, there is an important class of gestures known as anchoring.

Anchoring is holding the Aether still with one finger while performing another action with a different finger.  These gestures are:

MOVE BUBBLE [Anchor+Drag:bubble]
Anchor with one finger, then drag a bubble with another.  The more fingers that you use, the more bubbles you can drag around.

CONTEXT MENU [Anchor+Tap:bubble]
Anchor with one finger and tap a bubble with another.  This will bring up a context menu for the bubble that will allow you to perform additional actions to the bubble, such as Label and Delete.

LASSO [Anchor+Drag:aether]
Anchor with one finger and drag another finger on empty space.  A yellow path will begin to render along the path of your second finger.  You will be able to select multiple Bubbles and then move them as a group or perform relevant context menu actions on all of them.

MOVE CURSOR [Anchor+Tap:expression]
While editing an expression, anchor with one finger and tap the expression with another.  The cursor will move to the location of the tap, allowing you to modify the expression at that location.";
