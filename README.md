## Universe X
Come along as we explore this universe and discover the similarities and differences it has with our own.

There are things we know for certain about Universe X; there are things we can speculate about and there are many things yet to be discovered.  Hopefully, over the lifetime of this app we will be able to continually increase our knowledge and understanding of this new world.

## So what is Universe X?
Universe X is quite different from our own.  Our universe can, at times, seem quite magical: space curves, time dilates and both are intertwined with one another; it contains dark matter and dark energy; it is expanding and expanding at an increasing rate; God plays dice with our universe.

In contrast, Universe X is quite simple; it has no magic at all.  Universe X is entirely mechanistic.  It follows a few simple rules which are easy to understand and (hopefully) easy to model.

## The Aexel
Universe X consists of a large number of a single entity called an 'aexel'.

These aexels have state, they can move and flow, they can form bonds with their neighbors and send signals to those neighbors through those bonds.

And perhaps most surprisingly, they can be created and and they can be destroyed.

The entire DNA of the universe is contained in each one of these aexels.

## Space and Time
Unlike our own universe where space and time are quite magical notions, where space can curve and time can dilate and each is intimately intertwined with one another, in Universe X, space and time are quite intuitive and boring.

Space in Universe X does not curve or expand; it is simply a three dimensional construct which houses the aexels.  Time in Universe X does not dilate; it is simply a one dimensional construct moving at a constant rate from past to present to future, mediating the progression of the state changes of the aexels as well as their motion.  In Universe X space and time are entirely separate, entirely intuitive notions.

## The Goal
Of course, these facts about the aexels of Universe X leave many questions unanswered.  What is the mechanism by which aexels move?  How many dimensions of state are there?  How does their creation and destruction actually work?  Ultimately, the primary focus of this app is to discover the source code for the aexel, i.e., the DNA of Universe X.

As such, let our exploration begin...
